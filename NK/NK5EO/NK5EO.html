<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  One: Change in Nursing Practice – Use of Technology to Prevent Burns to  Patients </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  On February 7, 2016, Beaumont Grosse  Pointe (BGP) had an unexpected and unplanned incident occur on 2 South, the  Neuro-Stroke Unit. On morning rounds, Timothy Pierce, BSN, RN, clinical nurse,  2 South, was completing early morning physical assessments on his assigned patients. During one patient assessment, Pierce noticed  a quarter-sized wound with an open blister on the patient&rsquo;s upper back, which  appeared to be a second degree burn. The patient said she had been given a hot  pack by somebody during the night for her back pain. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pierce reviewed the patient&rsquo;s electronic  medical record, and it was documented that she had arrived on 2 South the  previous evening with intact skin. Pierce therefore surmised that the hot pack  had caused this burn. Because of the severity of the situation, he knew that  steps needed to be taken to prevent this from happening again.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pierce approached Pam Lively, BSN, RN,  Assistant Nurse Manager, 2 South, who instructed  Pierce to report the incident via RL Solution. RL Solution is an internal  electronic process for reporting quality and safety issues, concerns and  variances.  These reports are reviewed daily  by quality and safety leadership and routed to the appropriate leaders for  follow-up and review. The reports are also discussed at the daily operation  meeting attended by all nurse leaders.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After being approached by Pierce, Lively  began investigating the incident by identifying the those involved in the  patient&rsquo;s care and reviewing the documentation in the patient&rsquo;s chart. Lively  immediately began to share the details of the incident with nursing staff members  and to inquire about the process for providing a hot pack.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through these discussions with the  nursing staff, Lively identified that it was common practice to warm washcloths  with water from the hot water spigot and give these to patients who asked for a  hot pack. Clinical nurses and nursing care assistants (NCA) were surprised by  the reported injury, but also alarmed since the use of these hot packs had been  the practice on the unit for an undetermined length of time. The BGP procedure  for heating pads was to use a K-pad, which is an electric, temperature-controlled  moist heat device. However, nursing staff members said the K-pads were  difficult to obtain and frequently non-functional when they were, and that the  unit lacked the distilled water required for use with the K-Pad. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on Lively&rsquo;s conversations with  multiple 2 South nursing staff members, it was apparent that new technology and  a change in nursing practice were needed. Clinical nurses and NCAs could no  longer use moist towels warmed with hot water, but would have to use technology  that was appropriate for the condition they were trying to treat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the afternoon daily operation  meeting on February 8, 2016, Lively informed Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC,  Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer, of the burn incident, her conversations  with Pierce and the need to quickly come up with a plan to address this  incident. Lively also said she would talk with the caregiver involved in the  incident that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lively spoke with the NCA that evening,  and it was confirmed that the NCA had used the hot water spigot to make the hot  pack. The NCA&rsquo;s justification was that the K-pads never get warm enough or just  do not work, and that it was the practice for the clinical nurses and NCAs on 2  South to use a wash cloth and hot water for patients who request a hot pack. It  was clear that this was a patient safety issue and that a plan needed to be  developed to prevent this from happening again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lively and Kim Little, BSN, RN,  Assistant Nurse Manager, 2 South, met with Patricia Ackley, BSN, RN, Assistant  Nurse Manager, 3 West, and Alexis Rogers, RN, Assistant Nurse Manager, 3 South.  Lively shared the incident with Ackley and Rogers because she was concerned that  this might be the practice on other units as well. The incident was also shared  with other nursing leaders and all hospital leaders during the daily operation  meeting, through which it was confirmed that it was widespread practice to use  methods other than the approved technology to provide heat treatment.</p>
<p> <br>
  Lively worked with Becky Frank,  Secretary, Nursing Administration, to develop a weekly flyer titled, &ldquo;Be Aware  for Safe Care &amp; Use of K-Pads.&rdquo; This was then presented at the February 15,  2016 Model of Care Meeting, which is the weekly forum for communication between  nursing leaders, educators and nursing administrators. The flyer stated, &ldquo;if a  patient requests a hot pack, or there is a physician order for a hot pack you  must order the current technology provided by BGP, a K-Pad.  DO NOT warm a wet towel in the microwave or  put hot water on a towel….there is no regulation of the temperature and we have  burned (blistered) patients using both of these methods.&rdquo;      </p>
<p> <br>
  The &ldquo;Be Aware for Safe Care&rdquo; campaign  was rolled out to all staff members through the weekly huddle flyer on the same  day. This flyer is  the mechanism through which nursing leadership communicates information that  should be quickly disseminated. It is discussed with each oncoming shift for  the following week, and during these discussions the staff provided more information  about the use of the K-pads. Staff members said the supply of K-pads was  inadequate for the number of patients who request them, and they questioned  their functionality. A common concern was that the K-pads would not get hot  enough for the patients&rsquo; comfort, which over time had led to the use of hot  packs as an alternative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On February 18, 2016, Lively asked  Deborah Schroeder, BSN, RN, Educational Specialist, Nursing Education, for her  assistance in validating what the staff had said about the K-pads. Schroeder  randomly selected and tested three K-pads, two of which did not turn on and one  warmed up only minimally.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lively immediately shared this  information with Stewart and the other nurse leaders, and Lively informed John  Crissman, Biomedical and Safety Manager, of the issue with the K-pads.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biomedical Engineering conducted a  house-wide inventory and confirmed that the available fleet of K-pads was 10  years old and was showing its age in the increased number of reported failures.  Because of this unreliability, Crissman believed the appropriate process  improvement would be an emergency purchase of replacement K-pads.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lack of appropriate technology  resulted in a patient sustaining a burn-related injury in February 2016. This resulted in a rate of patient injuries  related to burns of 1.19 per 1,000 patient days at BGP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To decrease the rate of patient injuries related to  burns, as measured by the number of incidents per 1,000 patient days at BGP. <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  <em>March 1,  2016</em><br>
  Lively asked Schroeder to obtain  information about replacing all K-pads. A quote was obtained, and Lively presented  this to Stewart. Approval was obtained, and Lively ensured that 15 Gaymar  K-pads were purchased in February and placed into service in March 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>March 14,  2016</em><br>
  New K-pads were received. At Lively&rsquo;s  insistence, given the urgency of this issue, Nursing Education was asked to add  two new topics to the education plan for the clinical nurses and NCAs.  &ldquo;Hospital Acquired Burn- Case Study&rdquo; and &ldquo;Warm Compress Policy 780&rdquo; were added  to the March 2016 NCA education class and the April 2016 clinical nurse  education class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>March 28,  2016 </em><br>
  Lively announced at the Model of Care  Meeting that 15 new K-pads had been purchased and were ready to be used. This  information was disseminated to all staff members through the weekly huddle  flyer titled, &ldquo;Based on the concerns you voiced, we have purchased 15 new  K-pads.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information about the burn incident was  also disseminated and discussed to ensure clinical nurses understood the need  to use the appropriate technology to treat patients and to use the appropriate  process to report malfunctions of technology so devices can be repaired or  replaced.</p>

<p><strong>Outcomes</strong><br>
  Clinical nurses&rsquo; involvement in the design and  implementation of technology led to a change in the nursing practice of  providing heat treatments for patients. After upgrading to more current  technology, ensuring the necessary supply of this technology and changing nursing  practice, the rate of patient injuries related to burns at BGP decreased from 1.19 to 0. Through this  immediate change in nursing practice,  patient injuries related to burns were eliminated.</p>

<p align="center">Evidence NK5EO-1, BGP Patient  Injuries Due to Burns </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  Two: Improving the Patient Experience – Use of Vein Finders to Increase  Patients&rsquo; Comfort </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  In October 2014, clinical nurses in the Perioperative  area of Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) expressed concern regarding the acuity of  the patients who were having surgical procedures at BGP. As the hospital census  was increasing, so was the number of surgical patients. Physicians were admitting  higher acuity patients to BGP instead of to the major health center  approximately three miles away. Higher acuity patients have more comorbidities,  which can compromise the vascular system and make it more difficult to insert  an IV catheter.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perioperative clinical nurses Karen Thompson, BSN,  RN and Christina Spencer, RN were considered experts in IV starts. With decades  of experience between them, either Thompson or Spencer would be called to start  the IV whenever there was a patient on whom this was difficult; however, they  were being asked to perform more difficult IV starts.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During one of these, Nannette Zerb, RN, clinical  nurse, Perioperative shifts, observed that Thompson was having a difficult time  starting an IV and told her about technology that she had used at a different hospital  to start IVs, with great success. The technology, a vein visualization device,  improved nurses&rsquo; ability in successful venipuncture, decreased the number of  attempts and improved patient satisfaction with the process.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thompson and Simpson </a>approached Deborah Jankowski, BSN, RN, Administrative Manager,  Perioperative Services, about the possibility of obtaining  this technology to assist with vein visualization for starting IVs. Thompson  and Simpson suggested that using this new technology would result in fewer  unsuccessful venipuncture attempts, thereby decreasing patients&rsquo; discomfort and  increasing their satisfaction. Jankowski approached Linda Witt, MA, BSN, RN,  ONC, Director of Surgical Services, about the possibility of obtaining the vein  visualization technology for BGP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BGP uses Press Ganey as its vendor for measuring patient  satisfaction. The Perioperative Services uses the Ambulatory Surgery Survey. In  November 2014, the Perioperative Services ranked in the 2nd percentile  of the All Press Ganey database for the item, &ldquo;Skill of nurse starting IV.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To improve the Perioperative Services percentile  ranking for patient satisfaction with IV starts, as measured by the Press Ganey  item, &ldquo;Skill of nurse starting IV.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  <em>December 2014</em><br>
  Witt arranged for the company AccuVein to meet with Perioperative  Services to demonstrate the benefits and use of its vein visualization technology.  The meeting was attended by Perioperative Services and Anesthesia nursing  leadership, clinical nurses from Perioperative Services, physicians and  Materials Management staff.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AccuVein vein finder would be used in the Pre-Op  area on patients for whom IV starts are difficult to improve  nurses&rsquo; accuracy in initial IV attempts. Thompson  and Spencer, the experts in starting IVs in the Pre-Op area, were very impressed  with this new technology and believed it would help other clinical nurses in  the department with difficult IV starts. Thompson said that when they were  called to start an IV, the clinical nurse usually tried at least two times. She  said that the clinical nurse being able to get the IV started on the first try  would improve both nurse and patient satisfaction. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the demonstration of the vein finders, Darren  DeSmyter, AccuVein Sales Representative, explained that the AccuVein would increase  patient satisfaction. DeSmyter shared the following information, based on  research conducted by Press Ganey:</p>
<ul>
  <li>93% of patients surveyed said they would give a  higher satisfaction score if vein illumination was used.</li>
  <li>95% said that vein illumination would lead them to  consider the clinician more courteous. </li>
  <li>94% would have more respect for the clinician.</li>
  <li>98% would appreciate the clinician&rsquo;s extra effort  shown by using vein illumination.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the demonstration, Thompson and Spencer  advocated for the purchase of the vein finder technology to support clinical  nurses in Perioperative Services. On December 26, 2014, BGP received a quote  from AccuVein for the purchase of the vein finders. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>January 2015</em><br>
  Witt obtained approval for the purchase of three vein  finders for the Pre-Op, Endoscopy and Anesthesia areas. Witt worked with Cindy  Harrison, Director of Materials Management, to purchase the equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>February 2015</em><br>
  The vein finders were received at BGP. Education on  the new technology was arranged by Ruth Roberts, MSN, RN, CPAN, Educational  Specialist, Surgical Service. Roberts secured DeSmyter&rsquo;s services to complete  the education on how to use vein finders.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zerb was a strong advocate for implementing the vein  finder in practice, as she had used this technology at a different hospital. As  in-servicing was being provided, Zerb and Thompson assisted  in trialing the product. They both believed it was an excellent resource for  clinical nurses to use whenever they thought they were going to have a  difficult time starting an IV. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Education consisted of brief one-on-one in-services  with the clinical nurses in the Perioperative area. The product was well  received by the clinical nurses, as they were the ones who had brought forth  the idea because of the difficult IV starts they were experiencing in the Perioperative  area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementation, including education on the new technology  to assist nurses in Perioperative Services with IV insertion, was completed by  the end of February 2015.</p>
