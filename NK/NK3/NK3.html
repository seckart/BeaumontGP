  <p><em>Provide  one example, with supporting evidence, of how clinical nurses used  evidence-based findings to revise an existing practice to improve care.</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: Implementing a New Practice – The  Peanut Ball</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  January 2014, in preparation for the opening of a natural birth suite in the  Cotton Family Birth Center (CFBC) at Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP), Marisa Engel,  BSN, RNC-OB, C-EFM CFBC, clinical nurse, began investigating interventions for  managing patients who are interested in a natural birth. Engel collaborated  with Certified Nurse Midwives (CNM) Wendy Olsen, MSN, RN, CNM and Jennifer  Yeamans, MSN, RN, CNM, who provided suggestions for new interventions related  to the care of patients in labor. These included incorporating peanut balls  into the nurses&rsquo; practice. The peanut ball is a new tool being used to assist  women during the first and second stages of labor to improve maternal comfort  and reduce the length of labor. The peanut ball is a positioning device that is  placed between the patient&rsquo;s legs to open the pelvic outlet to allow more room  for the fetal presenting part to descend into the pelvis and exert pressure on  the cervix to promote cervical dilation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evidence-based  Knowledge</strong><br>
  Engel  conducted a literature search and found a small randomized control trial in the  Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic and Neonatal Nursing, published in 2011, that  investigated the use of a peanut ball during labor for women who had received  an epidural. The peanut ball was used once the patient had an epidural placed,  and it remained in use throughout the labor in conjunction with regular  position changes. The study concluded that the use of the peanut ball in labor reduced  the length of labor, with no adverse neonatal outcomes. The evidence from this  study showed that the peanut ball would be beneficial and should be  incorporated into CFBC clinical nurses&rsquo; practice. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Engel  presented the article at the CFBC Unit Practice Council (UPC) meeting in February  2014, where it was reviewed and discussed. The UPC members agreed that the  peanut ball would be a beneficial intervention, and as a result the CFBC  decided to pursue obtaining the peanut balls and then develop a plan to provide  education on how to use them. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK3-1.pdf">(Evidence  NK3-1, Article, Use of a Labor Ball to Decrease the Length of Labor in Patients  Who Received an Epidural, and UPC Minutes, February 2014)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later  in 2014, an article titled &ldquo;The Peanut Ball: A remarkable labor support tool,&rdquo;was published in the International  Doula journal. It described how the peanut ball can be used for laboring women  to increase comfort during contractions and decrease the length of labor. It  also described a variety of labor positions using the peanut ball and how these  can improve labor patterns. Copies of this article were posted on the unit as a  resource for the clinical nurses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based  on the evidence and input from the UPC and CNMs, Engel approached Patricia  Heitz, RN, CFBC Assistant Nurse Manager, about the possibility of ordering  peanut balls for the unit. A set of the peanut balls was purchased in August  2014 and received in September 2014. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK3-2.pdf">(Evidence NK3-2, Purchase Order for Peanut Balls and Article) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  October 2014, Engel attended the Natural Childbirth Workshop, a childbirth  education series offered by Beaumont University and taught by Susan Cencer,  BSN, RN, Childbirth Educator. Engel attended as an observer to assess how  patients were being educated on the use of the peanut ball in labor. During  this class, Engel observed the peanut ball in use in a variety of labor  positions and learned how to position the patient to promote comfort and fetal  descent using the ball. Cencer had clinical experience using the peanut ball  with labor patients and attested to their usefulness, saying that she had found  in her experience that labor length and pushing time were reduced. The peanut  ball is a tool that the clinical nurse can implement to promote continued labor  progress and improve the likelihood of a vaginal birth, which aligns with the  goal of decreasing the cesarean section rate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Education and  Implementation of the New Practice for Clinical Nurses </strong><br>
  In  November 2014, Cencer presented an educational offering to CFBC clinical nurses  about natural birth and the use of the peanut ball for laboring women. During  this education session, Cencer gave suggestions for the different uses of the  peanut ball for positioning laboring women and allowed clinical nurses to have  hands-on practice using peanut balls of different sizes. Clinical nurses took  turns lying in the labor bed and practiced the labor positions using the peanut  ball. This education was also shared in daily huddles with clinical nurses who  had been unable to attend the in-service. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK3-3.pdf">(Evidence NK3-3, Sign-in Sheet for Natural Birthing and  Peanut Ball in Labor Class November 11, 2014) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  December 2014, the new practice of using a peanut ball for laboring women was  implemented in conjunction with the opening of the Natural Birth Suite on the  CFBC. The peanut ball has become part of clinical nurses&rsquo; standard care for  labor patients. It is most commonly used for patients who are in bed during the  active phase of labor, often once they have received an epidural.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  June 2015, Engel, Heitz and clinical nurses Geraldine Kalkman, RN, C-EFM and  Melissa Aughe, BSN, RN, C-EFM attended the Natural Birth: Back to Basics  conference offered by Beaumont Health System to improve the care provided to  patients who desire a low-intervention birth.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One  of the presentations included education on the use of a peanut ball in labor,  which reinforced the clinical nurses&rsquo; knowledge about providing care for  laboring women. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK3-4.pdf">(Evidence  NK3-4, PowerPoint of Peanut Ball Presentation at the Natural Birth: Back to  Basics Conference)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinical  nurses assist the patient to move into a variety of positions, including side-lying,  semi-fowlers and hands-and-knees, changing positions every 30 minutes. The  peanut ball is positioned between the patient&rsquo;s legs to help open the pelvis,  which promotes fetal descent, optimal positioning and rotation of the fetal head.  It is also used during the second stage of labor, while the patient is actively  pushing.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When  it was initially implemented, the peanut ball was documented on the labor flowsheet  under &ldquo;positioning device, other,&rdquo; with &ldquo;peanut ball&rdquo; then free texted in the  comment field. In August 2015, as the other Beaumont sites began to implement  the peanut ball, an IT request was made to create a distinct field in the Epic  electronic medical record to document the use of the peanut ball for  positioning. In April 2016, &ldquo;peanut ball&rdquo; was added to Epic as a position  device in the labor flowsheet to allow the clinical nurse to document its use. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK3-5.pdf">(Evidence NK3-5, Screen Shot of  Documentation of the Use of the Peanut Ball)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CFBC  clinical nurses have reported decreases in lengths of labor and in pushing  times, especially in nulliparous women. The patient response has been positive,  as they are pleased that the clinical nurse is performing interventions to  promote active fetal descent and to potentially shorten the length of their  labor. The new practice of using the peanut ball in the Cotton Family Birth  Center continues to be used as an effective way to decrease labor length for  the patient.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Two: Revising  an Existing Practice – Infant Safe Sleep Practices, Changing from Blankets to  Sleep Sacks</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evidence-based  Knowledge</strong><br>
  Barb Sheppard, RN,  C-EFM, clinical nurse, Cotton Family Birth Center (CFBC), has over 20 years of  experience in administering nursing care to women in labor and their newborns.  Sheppard is a strong proponent of the safe sleep  initiatives recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sleeping supine on flat surface</li>
  <li>Sleeping in an improved sleep surface without additional items (bumper  pads, toys, blankets)</li>
  <li>Infant never sleeps in caregiver sleep space</li>
  <li>Supervised tummy time while infant is awake</li>
  <li>Sleep swaddles to be used in lieu of blankets to provide warmth </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These initiatives  have been a safety focus for birth centers nationally, and especially in Wayne  County, Michigan, because of the high rate of death associated with unsafe  sleep conditions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  early August 2013, to increase clinical nurses&rsquo; knowledge of the importance of  safe sleep, Beaumont Health prepared educational materials and a test that was  added to the orientation book for all new FBC nurses hired at Beaumont Grosse  Pointe (BGP), and it issued pocket reminders for clinical nurses and  physicians. This new test was also mandated for staff members currently working  in a role that involves providing direct care to newborns, as they have the  opportunity to provide patient education about safe sleep guidelines. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  late August 2013, Sheppard conducted an informal audit to assess clinical  nurses&rsquo; compliance with BGP safe sleep practices to align with standards of  care. The results of the audit highlighted a need to reinforce education for clinical  nurses, who in turn would share the education with new mothers, families and  caregivers. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK3-6.pdf">(Evidence NK3-6,  American Academy of Pediatrics, Interventions Improved Safe Sleep Practices in  NICU; Safe Sleep Observation Audit Tools) </a><br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As  safe sleep is a passion of Sheppard&rsquo;s, she provides education in the community in  addition to working with clinical nurses to ensure they are knowledgeable about safe sleep practices. She attends baby fairs  sponsored throughout the community to present information on safe sleep, set up  models of safe sleep practices and show a video produced through the State of  Michigan regarding this dangerous trend affecting our youngest population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BGP  is in Wayne County, which has one of the highest death rates associated with  unsafe sleep practices in Michigan. The issue of unsafe sleep practices was  so important that in 2014 the governor of Michigan signed into law a bill that  governshospital  requirements related to infant safe sleep practices and education for new  parents. A section of bill the reads: <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sec.  5887. The department and the department of human services shall collaborate to  do all of the following: <br>
  <p20>(a)  Work to improve community-based services available to inform parents regarding the risk factors associated with infant death due to unsafe sleep practices and infant safe sleep practices. </p20> <br>
  <p20>(b)  Work with other state and local governmental agencies, community organizations, health care  and humanservice providers, and national organizations to  coordinate efforts and maximize state and private resources in education  regarding the risk factors associated with infant death due to unsafe sleep practices and infant safe sleep practices. </p20><br>
   <p20>(c) Provide educational  and instructional materials that explain the risk factors associated with infant death due to unsafe sleep practices, that include methods to reduce the  risk of infant death due to unsafe sleep, and that emphasize infant safe sleep  practices.</p20></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Sheppard knew the importance of  safe sleep practices, it was now mandated at the state level that all  hospitals, including BGP, be responsible for educating the caregivers of  newborns on safe sleep. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  January 2015, Patricia Heitz, RNC-OB, C-EFM, Assistant Nurse Manager, Family  Birth Center, was invited to the Wayne County Infant Safe Sleep Coalition. This  meeting consisted of many healthcare providers throughout Wayne county who came  together to strategize ways to address the sustained high rate of unsafe sleep  practices in the community. While at this meeting, Heitz determined that  Sheppard would be the perfect activist and an excellent addition to the  coalition based on her longstanding passion in advocating for newborns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Facts  Regarding Safe Sleep in the Service Area </strong><br>
  In April 2015,  Heitz and Sheppard attended another Wayne County Infant Safe Sleep Coalition meeting,  where they learned some important facts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>From 2010-2012, there  were 212 sleep-related infant deaths in the City of Detroit.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>2.6 deaths per 1,000  live births in Wayne County, which is twice the overall rate in Michigan. </li>
  <li>Nearly 90% of  sleep-related deaths in Wayne County occurred in an unsafe sleep location, as  defined by the AAP (the majority in an adult bed, followed by a couch).&nbsp; </li>
  <li>In Wayne County,  two-thirds of infants found unresponsive were in a position other than on their  backs&nbsp;(the majority on their stomach). </li>
  <li>Half of the deaths in  Wayne County from unsafe sleep occurred before 3 months of age. </li>
  <li>90% of Wayne County  deaths were on Medicaid health insurance. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The areas that healthcare providers who  attended the coalition determined to be vital included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Addressing new parents  in the hospital</li>
  <li>Education for  grandparents</li>
  <li>Best practices for  train the trainer activities for community members and health providers</li>
  <li>How to effectively use  social media to raise awareness</li>
  <li>Tummy time and clutter  free environment</li>
  <li>Informational DVDs for  waiting rooms</li>
  <li>Prevention of co-sleeping  strategies</li>
  <li>Need for car seat  safety</li>
  <li>Smoking</li>
  <li>Breastfeeding and safe  sleep</li>
  <li>Metro Detroit awareness  of current status</li>
  <li>Community resources and  awareness</li>
  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK3-7.pdf">(Evidence NK3-7, Agenda and Emails  Regarding Safe Sleep Coalition from January and April 2015 Meeting)</a>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disseminating Evidence-based  Practice</strong> <br>
  The Wayne County Infant Safe Sleep Coalition&rsquo;s emphasis  was to be instrumental in bringing the current recommendations regarding safe  sleep to the community. The attention would focus on marketing. Ideas from the  coalition meeting included educational classes for expectant mothers;  billboards; and community workshops that target parents, social workers and  child care providers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An AAP article from 2013, which discussed  recommended interventions to improve safe sleep habits, was also shared at the  coalition meeting. These habits and practices have been shown to have a direct  correlation to reducing sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Across the nation,  and at BGP, the movement was to have &ldquo;every baby, every time&rdquo; placed on their  back for sleep. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the coalition meeting, Sheppard  realized that many mothers seen at BGP were  practicing unsafe sleep practices with their infants. Discussion with multiple  professionals at the coalition meeting gave Sheppard a better understanding of  why it is so difficult to make changes. At BGP, many mothers are not looking  for new information, but are trusting their parents and friends for their  information on caring for their infants. This information can be built on out-of-date,  unsafe practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this  meeting, Sheppard and Heitz learned of a Wayne County initiative that would  allow expectant mothers who meet eligibility requirements to receive a  Pack-N-Play free of charge to reduce co-sleeping, which is one of the primary  unsafe sleep practices. Information about this program is shared with those who  meet the criteria when they are admitted for delivery. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK3-8.pdf">(Evidence NK3-8, Information Regarding Safe Sleep and  Pack-N-Play Eligibility Requirements)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Revision  of Existing Practice</strong> <br>
  The information discussed at the  coalition led to changes in nursing practice on the BGP Family Birth Center,  led by Sheppard. With the staggering numbers of preventable deaths forefront in  Sheppard&rsquo;s mind, her desire for safe sleep practices was re-energized. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beaumont Health policy was changed in March  2015 to incorporate Revised Safe Sleep in Infants. The policy was reviewed by  the Clinical Nurse Specialist, Administrative Manager and Chief Nursing Officers  from Beaumont Grosse Pointe, Royal Oak and Troy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The changes in practice that were incorporated  were;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The clinical nurses  using a swaddle instead of a blanket</li>
  <li>The clinical nurses  incorporating the concept of &ldquo;nothing in the bed except the baby&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheppard learned of a free swaddle program  through Halo innovations that would provide the swaddles that BGP would use in  place of blankets to reinforce the importance of safe sleep practices. The  patients would receive the swaddles that would be used throughout their stay.  This practice reinforced to the patient and family a consistent message  regarding these practices. Along with the free swaddle program came a focus on  the need for education regarding &ldquo;nothing in the bed except the baby.&rdquo; <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK3-9.pdf">(Evidence NK3-9, Policy 6068 Infant  Safe Sleep, Less than 1 Year of Age and PO and Information regarding Halo  Swaddles Program)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheppard instructed staff members individually  and, as it became available, provided new information on safe sleep guidelines,  and information and strategies to ensure that the education reaches those who  need it most, the caregivers of newborns. She reviewed the infant safe sleep post-test and education card to  ensure that all clinical nurses would have the correct knowledge regarding safe  sleep. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/NK3-10.pdf">(Evidence NK3-10,  Infant Safe Sleep Post Test and Education Card) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To model the  behaviors, nurse would need to consistently demonstrate safe practices while  couplets are in their care. Sheppard focused on educating the nurses on the  need to keep all objects out of the crib and to show the proper use of a  swaddle when the first bath is given. Sheppard believed that instructing  mothers at bath time would be effective, as they are receptive to bonding and  important discussions can be held about infant care while the importance of  safe sleep guidelines is instilled. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheppard continues to serve on the corporate Safe  Sleep Task Force and was part of the initiative that led to the &ldquo;Infant safe-sleep  refresher&rdquo; module, which is required for nurses caring for newborns in Beaumont  Health. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BGP Family Birth Center has been an  advocate for safe sleep practices for many years. Evidence of this commitment  is found in the purchasing of a swaddle sack that is given to every new baby  born at BGP. </p>
