<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  One: Professional Development to Improve Practice – Improving Skin-to-Skin  Contact for the Mother and Baby in the Family Birth Center   </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  In March 2012, the Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP)  Family Birth Center (FBC) attained the World Health Organization (WHO) Baby-Friendly  Designation. The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is a worldwide  program created by WHO and the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF) in 1991  to encourage and recognize facilities that engage in evidence-based practices  for infant feeding and mother-baby bonding.   BFHI focuses on education and supporting mothers to ensure positive  breastfeeding outcomes given the proven, extensive benefits of breastfeeding  for mothers, babies and communities. The goal of  the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative is to give all mothers  the information, confidence and skills needed to successfully initiate and  continue breastfeeding their babies or feeding formula safely, and it gives  special recognition to hospitals that do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve and maintain Baby-Friendly designation, the  FBC must adhere to the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding outlined by Baby-Friendly  USA:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a written breastfeeding policy that is  routinely communicated to all health care staff</li>
  <li>Train all healthcare staff in the skills necessary  to implement this policy</li>
  <li>Inform all pregnant women about the benefits and  management of breastfeeding</li>
  <li>Help mothers to initiate breastfeeding within a half  hour of birth</li>
  <li>Show mothers how to breastfeed, and how to maintain  lactation even if they should be separated from their infants</li>
  <li>Give newborn infants no food or drink other than  breastmilk, unless medically indicated</li>
  <li>Practice rooming in, allows mothers and infants to  remain together 24 hours a day</li>
  <li>Encourage breastfeeding on demand</li>
  <li>Give no artificial nipples or pacifiers to  breastfeeding infants</li>
  <li>Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support  groups and refer mothers to them after discharge from hospital or clinic</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patricia Ashley, RN, IBCLC, FBC Lactation Consultant,  is the coordinator of the Baby-Friendly steps and identifies areas in which further  training and education are needed.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the Baby-Friendly visit in 2012, one learning  need that was identified was placing the infant skin-to-skin on the mother&rsquo;s  chest immediately after birth. The recommendation for Baby-Friendly&rsquo;s Step  Four, &ldquo;Help  mothers to initiate breastfeeding within a half hour of birth,&rdquo; is to place the  infant directly on the mother&rsquo;s bare chest immediately after delivery and allow  the infant to remain there for at least one hour or until the first  breastfeeding is completed.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skin-to-skin  contact is important for the mother and baby because it stimulates milk  production and promotes mother-baby bonding.
  <br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  November 2013, 76% of FBC patients engaged in skin-to-skin contact with their  baby immediately after birth. The Baby-Friendly goal for this measure is 80%.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal Statement</strong><br>
  To increase the percentage of FBC patients engaging  in skin-to-skin contact with their baby immediately after birth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  <em>December 2013 </em><br>
  The multidisciplinary  FBC Breastfeeding Task Force meets regularly to discuss ways to improve  skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding. Its members include Ashley; Patricia  Heitz, BSN, RNC-OB, C-EFM, Assistant Nurse Manager; Janice Davis, BSN, RNC-OB,  C-EFM, Assistant Nurse Manager; Cheryl Gibson, MD, Obstetrics; Kathleen  Rollinger, DO, Obstetrics; and Jeanne Lewandowski, MD, Chief, Pediatrics. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ashley  presented the monthly breastfeeding data to the Breastfeeding Task Force in  December 2013, and she asked the group for input into interventions to improve clinical  nurses&rsquo; practice of placing the infant skin-to-skin with the mother after every  delivery.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Breastfeeding  Task Force decided to initiate a multifaceted professional development activity  for FBC clinical nurses to improve the FBC&rsquo;s practice of skin-to-skin contact.  This activity would include education sessions, an educational video  demonstrating how and why skin-to-skin contact is important for the infant and  mother, and one-on-one education for nurses who were struggling with immediate skin-to-skin  contact.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Early January 2014 </em><br>
  Ashley  developed education materials for use later in the month. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Late January-February 2014</em><br>
  Ashley  held multiple education sessions at change of shift to educate clinical nurses on  how to successfully incorporate the practice of placing the infant skin-to-skin  with the mother after delivery. The education objectives included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Importance of  skin-to-skin contact</li>
  <li>Role of the nurse in  skin-to-skin contact</li>
  <li>Correct way to complete  skin-to-skin contact</li>
  <li>Importance of not  delaying skin-to-skin contact</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinical nurses were given information about the  benefits of skin-to-skin contact for the mother and the infant, including: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Enhanced bonding </li>
  <li>Better infant weight  gain </li>
  <li>Increased duration of breastfeeding</li>
  <li>Analgesic effects  during painful procedures for the infant</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The education  sessions also included instruction on educating the mother and her support  person on the practice and benefits of skin-to-skin contact, and on modifying  nursing interventions to allow the infant to remain with the mother for at  least one hour.Ashley also  used a video in the education sessions demonstrating the practice of  skin-to-skin after delivery, and clinical nurses who were not practicing  skin-to-skin with patients received one-on-one education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FBC clinical  nurses completed the mandatory Breastfeeding Competency Quiz, which included an  assessment of their knowledge of skin-to-skin practices. As this quiz was  mandatory, 100% of FBC nurses participated in this professional development activity  during the two months. Ashley was instrumental in ensuring that all clinical  nurses received the education.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  professional development activity of teaching skin-to-skin contact resulted in  a change in practice for all nurses on the FBC. The clinical nurses were  educated on the skill of providing skin-to-skin contact, and Ashley had them  complete return demonstrations to ensure they had acquired the knowledge and  retained the information that was taught during the professional development  activity.  </p>

<p><strong>Outcomes</strong><br>
  The professional development activity for nurses resulted  in a practice improvement, as evidenced by an increase in the percentage of FBC  patients engaging in skin-to-skin contact with their baby immediately following  delivery. This increased from 76% in November 2013 to 100% in June 2014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center"><img src="Images/graph1.png" width="760"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">Evidence SE4EO-1, FBC Patients  with Skin to Skin Contact Immediately after Birth</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  Two: Nursing Education Improves Head CT Turnaround Time </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  The Stroke Team is a multidisciplinary  group with members from numerous departments. It includes nurses, physicians,  physical and occupational therapists, speech therapists and representatives  from Radiology and Laboratory. The team meets monthly to discuss stroke core  measures, internal quality indicators, best practices, case reviews and process  improvement plans. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One internal quality indicator the team  reviews is Head Computed Tomography (CT), defined as timely brain imaging through  a head CT, which is critical to the rapid evaluation and diagnosis of patients  with a possible ischemic stroke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brain imaging findings, including the  size, location and vascular distribution of the infarction; the presence of  bleeding; severity of ischemic stroke; and/or presence of large-vessel  occlusion, can affect immediate and long-term treatment decisions. Information  about the possible degree and reversibility of ischemic injury, the status of  the intracranial vessels and the status of cerebral hemodynamics can be  obtained from imaging. Obtaining a non-contrast head CT is important for the identification  of contraindications to fibrinolysis, and it allows patients with ischemic  stroke to receive timely intravenous fibrinolytic therapy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emergency Center (EC) clinical nurses play a critical role by calling a Code Stroke for  any new patient presenting with neurological symptoms and a &ldquo;last known well&rdquo;  of less than 12 hours. &ldquo;Last known well&rdquo; is the time when the neurological  symptoms first started, either inside or outside of the hospital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EC nurses participate in the Stroke  Champion Program, initiated in 2013. The Stroke Champions are key stakeholders  who function as resources and clinical experts and have a strong influence on  process and action plans driving the Stroke Program from the bedside. The  Stroke Champion role has the potential to improve clinical performance, quality of care and process  improvement opportunities.&nbsp;The Stroke Champion Program uses a shared governance model,  which supports Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP)  professional nursing practice. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the requirements for Stroke Champions  is to attend at least one Stroke Team meeting annually to help nurses understand  how process changes can affect data and improve patient outcomes. Minutes are  recorded for the Stroke Team meetings and shared with the participants. Outcome  data is shared with the entire EC at the monthly multidisciplinary team  meetings. At the monthly Stroke Champion meetings, stroke core measures,  internal quality indicators, best practices and case study reviews are  provided. EC nurse Stroke Champions frequently discuss ways to improve CT turnaround  time (TAT), with suggestions taken to the EC leadership team and incorporated  into practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several EC nurses, including Clinical  Nurse Specialist Sandra Rizzo, MSN, RN, CEN and clinical nurses Joan Shimko,  BSN, RN, CEN; Alfonso Flores, BSN, RN; Sundara Ganti, BSN, RN; and Angel Thomas,  BSN, RN, have participated in Stroke Team meetings and shared ideas to improve  CT-TAT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a possible stroke patient presents  to the EC, the nurse triages the patient, escorts them to a category 1 bed,  alerts the EC physician, obtains vitals, checks blood sugar and then takes the  patient immediately to CT scan. A category 1 bed is the highest priority bed in  the Emergency Center. Stroke protocols and pathways and the availability of a  stroke team speed the clinical assessment, the performance of diagnostic  studies and the decision for early management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May 2016, a  review of the data from the Emergency Center showed three stroke patients for  whom a Code Stroke was not called. This caused a delay in triage and increased the  time for the CT scan to be completed. It was determined that there was an  opportunity for improvement, with one of the suggestions being to provide EC  clinical nurses with education on the protocol for stroke patients.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A professional  development activity was needed to provide education, with the goal of improving  the process by streamlining it and thereby decreasing the time it takes for a  patient with stroke symptoms to receive a head CT scan within 45 minutes of  arrival to the EC. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May 2016, 25% of patients with stroke  symptoms and a last known well (LKW) of less than 12 hours received a head CT within  45 minutes of arrival to the EC.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal Statement</strong><br>
  Increase the percentage  of patients with stroke symptoms and an LKW of less than 12 hours who receive a head CT  within 45 minutes of arrival to the EC.<strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  From June 2016  through August 2016, a series of professional development activities were provided  to EC nurses to decrease the time from presentation to head CT for patients  presenting with stroke symptoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>June 2016</em><br>
  In response to the  May 2016 CT turnaround time, Steve Apigo, BSN, RN, Director of Emergency Center,  conducted EC staff meetings and informed the staff to be ready to transport  stroke patients quickly for diagnostic testing, including CT. He also began  holding daily huddles to discuss any fallout or areas needing improvement,  including CT-TAT. This information was reinforced with the EC nursing staff in  daily huddles. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shimko, clinical nurse  and Stroke Champion, reported at the June 2016 Stroke Team meeting that EC nursing  leadership was reviewing all stroke patients with an LKW less than 12 hours and  the use of the CT Stroke Protocol.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To assist in educating  clinical nurses, Beaumont Health developed the &ldquo;FASTER&rdquo; mnemonic for  remembering the warning signs and symptoms of a stroke:</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>F=Face</li>
    <li>A=Arm</li>
    <li>S=Stability</li>
    <li>T=Talking</li>
    <li>E=Eyes</li>
    <li>R=React</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cathleen Solecki, MSN, RN-BC, CCRN,  CNRN, Clinical Program Manager, developed a stroke tip sheet for the EC nurses to  improve their knowledge of the stroke protocols.  The clinical nurses were required to improve their knowledge of the stroke  protocols so they would be better prepared to respond to patients who present  to the EC with stroke-like symptoms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solecki developed a Stroke Reference Binder and  provided a copy to the EC as an educational resource for clinical nurses. The  binder included the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Stroke Algorithm </li>
  <li>Code Stroke Page </li>
  <li>Clinical Practice  Guidelines from American Heart Association/American Stroke Association </li>
  <li>National Institute for  Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) </li>
  <li>Symptoms of interruption  of blood supply to various cerebral vessels </li>
  <li>Inclusion/exclusion for  Alteplase </li>
  <li>Post Alteplase  Worksheet </li>
  <li>Stroke Tips Sheet and  Core Measure Update  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  Stroke Reference Binder was reviewed with the clinical nurses during the unit staff  meeting and daily huddles. The clinical nurses were expected to know the  content of the binder and be able to provide the care that is required to  ensure that patients receive a head CT scan based on the established guidelines. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>July 2016</em><br>
  Rizzo  developed a flyer and PowerPoint  presentation that outlined the order of care that  should be provided when a patient presents to the EC with stroke symptoms. The  overall objective of this educational activity was  to ensure that clinical nurses have the knowledge needed to recognize the signs  and symptoms of stroke and to ensure the patient receives the head CT scan  within 45 minutes of arrival to the EC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This education was provided to EC clinical nurses through  huddles, orientation and one-on-one. Because of employee scheduling, the  education was completed within  a month, and approximately 90% of nurses received the in-person education. Those  who were unable to attend the live education received a copy of the information  and were asked to review the content and see Rizzo with any questions.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reinforce the  education that was provided in the professional development activity, Solecki  developed acute care pocket cards that were provided to the EC clinical nurses.  The information on the pocket cards included the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stroke Signs and  Symptoms</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sudden  numbness or weakness of face, arm or leg – especially on one side of the body </li>
  <li>Sudden confusion,  trouble speaking or understanding</li>
  <li>Sudden trouble seeing  in one or both eyes</li>
  <li>Sudden trouble walking,  dizziness, loss of balance or coordination</li>
  <li>Sudden severe headache  with no known cause</li>
</ul>
<p>Goal Times</p>
<ul>
  <li>15 minutes - Door to MD<strong></strong></li>
  <li>25 minutes - Door to CT<strong></strong></li>
  <li>45 minutes - CT, lab,  CXR &amp; EKG results<strong></strong></li>
  <li>60 minutes - Door to IV  tPA </li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment  Windows</p>
<ul>
  <li>IV t-PA - 0-3 hours  (Select patients up to 4.5 hours)</li>
  <li>IA (Intra-arterial)  t-PA - 3-6 hours</li>
  <li>Mechanical Thrombectomy </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Anterior circulation up to 12 hours</li>
    <li>Vertebral-basilar up to 24 hours </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On July 31, 2016,<strong> </strong>Solecki  developed a Stroke &ldquo;badge buddy&rdquo; with core measures and the FASTER mnemonic to  give physicians and clinical  nurses easy access to the protocol for stroke  patients. A badge buddy is a card that is connected to the hospital  identification badge and makes important information readily available to  clinical nurses. This was developed to give the clinical nurses ready access to  the information they learned in the education sessions so they can recognize the signs and symptoms of stroke  and ensure that patients receive the head CT scan within 45 minutes of arrival  to the EC.<strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>August  2016</em><br>
  To further reinforce the education, Solecki  and Rizzo initiated a Mock Code for the EC multidisciplinary staff, using a  Beaumont Grosse Pointe volunteer acting as a stroke patient. The &ldquo;patient&rdquo;  arrived in the EC  with right facial droop, right sided weakness and dizziness. The triage clinical  nurse assessed the patient, placed him in a wheelchair and immediately took him  back to a category 1 bed. The clinical nurse assessed the patient, called a  Code Stroke and notified the EC physician. The unit secretary called the Code Stroke,  and the stroke protocol was initiated. The EC nurse then took the patient to CT.  This process was timed to assess the CT-TAT. </p>
<p>A debriefing was completed after the  mock code with EC clinical nurses and the EC tech, EC physician and EC charge  nurse. Areas of opportunity were reviewed with the nursing team. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>August 2016 </em><br>
  Adult Stroke Advanced Treatment Guidelines (ATG) were revised  and approved by the Corporate EC Policy and Procedure Manual. The ATG guidelines were  reviewed with EC nurses to ensure their understanding of the practices. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On August 29, 2016, Stroke Narrator in Epic, BGP&rsquo;s electronic  medical record, went live for better documentation of the care of stroke  patients.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Outcomes</strong><br>
  After clinical nurses in the Emergency Center participated  in a series of professional development activities on stroke protocol, the percentage of  patients with stroke symptoms who receive a head CT within 45 minutes of arrival  to EC with an LKW of less than 12 hours  increased from 25% in March 2016 to 83% in December 2016.</p>
