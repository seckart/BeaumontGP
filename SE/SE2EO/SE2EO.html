<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: NICHE  Conference – Improving the Care of Dementia and Elderly Patients on 2 South </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  The  average age of inpatients at Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) is 78 years. To  better serve older adult patients, BGP became a Nurses Improving Care for Healthsystem  Elders (NICHE)-designated hospital in 2014.<strong> </strong>NICHE is the leading nurse-driven program designed to help hospitals and  healthcare organizations improve the care of older adults. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As  part of the NICHE program, BGP rolled out the Geriatric Institutional  Assessment Profile (GIAP) in 2015. Through this assessment, a gap in knowledge  about caring for older patients or patients with dementia was identified.  Specific areas of need identified through the GIAP included dealing with the  behavior changes and cognitive issues experienced by patients with dementia,  and staff education on dementia/delirium to support NICHE goals. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christine  Hoffman, RN, clinical nurse, 3 West, has worked in medical/surgical nursing at  BGP since 2011 and has been very active with the geriatric patient population.  Her interest in geriatrics was strengthened through her participation in NICHE.  Hoffman believes that nurses need to be more attentive to the needs of dementia  patients and that they are not always comfortable with managing behavior symptoms  associated with dementia. Hoffman recognized that the geriatric patient  population is the one most affected by dementia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hoffman  shared her interest in geriatrics with Cathleen Solecki, MSN, RN-BC, CCRN,  CNRN, Clinical Program Manager/NICHE Coordinator, and said she wanted to be  involved in increasing the knowledge of nurses caring for older patients with  dementia. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  January 2016, Hoffman and Solecki received approval from Anne Stewart, MBA,  BSN, RNC, NE-BC Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer, to attend the  National NICHE Conference in April 2016. The NICHE conference highlights  evidence-based innovations and research, and supports hospitals in meeting the  challenges of quality care for older adults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At  this conference, Hoffman and Solecki attended several presentations on caring  for dementia patients. For example, they attended the Patient, Family,  Caregiver session entitled, &ldquo;Living with Dementia: Patient and Family  Narratives to Build Understanding Among Healthcare Professionals,&rdquo; and they  attended a roundtable discussion on delirium entitled, &ldquo;Decreasing Delirium  Resolution Times for the Elderly: An Interdisciplinary Approach.&rdquo; Hoffman was  enthusiastic about bringing this information to BGP and sharing it with the  nursing staff to improve the care of patients with dementia. After  participating in the conference, Hoffman earned her certification in  Gerontology from the American Nurses Credentialing Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  February 2016, Solecki was forwarded an email from Stewart that had been sent  to her from Samuel Flanders, MD, Senior Vice President and Chief Quality  Officer, Beaumont Health, regarding an opportunity to receive a corporate  patient safety grant. Solecki submitted the application in February 2016 and  received funding to plan, implement and evaluate the Virtual Dementia Tour  (VDT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It  was believed that the VDT would change nurses&rsquo; practice in caring for dementia  patients. The anticipated outcome of the VDT was that it would increase the clinical  nurses&rsquo; understanding of the physical and mental challenges that dementia  patients face, and that they would use this experience to provide better  patient centered care. It was also thought that the VDT program might have an  indirect impact on decreasing falls and restraint use. Hospital leadership also  believed that the VDT experience would impact how nurses care for all patients  by bringing a patient-focused perspective, and that this would have a positive  impact on patient satisfaction scores. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  goal of the program was to increase the HCAHPS mean score for &ldquo;Staff took my  preferences and those of my family or caregiver into account in deciding my  healthcare needs.&rdquo; In May 2016, the mean score was 80%. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To  increase the HCAHPS mean score for the item, &ldquo;Staff took my preferences and  those of my family or caregiver into account in deciding my healthcare needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description of the  Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  <em>June-July 2016</em><br>
  After seeing  information about a Virtual Dementia Tour at the NICHE conference, Hoffman was  eager to bring the program to BGP, supported by the grant. Solecki contacted  Second Winds, a company that sells a dementia tour program, to inquire about  the VDT program and what is required to use their class. Solecki received a  contract template and licensing agreement from Second Winds, and the contract  was sent to and reviewed by Beaumont Health Legal Department.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>August 2016 </em><br>
  Solecki met with Stewart  to discuss the logistics of the program, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The cost of the program,  including materials and personnel </li>
  <li>Location for training  facilitators </li>
  <li>Location of the VDT  experience for clinical nurses</li>
  <li>Scheduling for the  facilitators and the experience</li>
  <li>Evaluation of program, and  pre- and post-survey</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>September 2016 </em><br>
  Solecki received  approval from the Legal Affairs Office for the contract with Second Winds, and  the contract and licensing agreement were signed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following clinical  nurses and staff members volunteered to serve as facilitators for the VDT. The facilitator  training was provided over two days:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Christine Hoffman, RN,  clinical nurse, 3 West</li>
  <li>Alfonso Flores, BSN,  RN, clinical nurse, Emergency Center</li>
  <li>Debra Briske, MSN, RN,  CEN, Clinical Nurse Specialist</li>
  <li>Angela Falzarano, MSN,  RN-BC, Clinical Nurse Specialist</li>
  <li>Edmund Neumaier, BSN,  RN, Palliative Care Coordinator</li>
  <li>Sandra Rizzo, MSN, RN,  CEN Clinical Nurse Specialist</li>
  <li>Cathleen Solecki, MSN,  RN-BC, CCRN, CNRN, Clinical Program Manager</li>
  <li>Lisa Hartner, Program  Manager</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>October 2016 </em><br>
  The first VDT  experience, scheduled for November 1, 2016, was planned. Hoffman, Neumaier and  Solecki purchased equipment for the VDT experience, which would be open to any  clinical nurse, nursing care assistant and direct care staff member. Participants  signed up in Halogen, BGP&rsquo;s online education program. The goal was to have as  many clinical nurses and nursing care assistants as possible attend. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience included  the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Participants took a pre-survey  on their perception of taking care of dementia patients.</li>
  <li>Participants were given  an explanation of what the VDT experience would entail.</li>
  <li>Participants donned  gloves to simulate arthritis and loss of fine motor control, black dotted  glasses to simulate vision loss, headphones connected to an MP3 player to  simulate muted voices and static noise, and shoe inserts to simulate  neuropathy.</li>
  <li>Participants were taken  to a dimly lit room to begin the experience.</li>
  <li>To simulate the  dementia experience, the trained facilitators guided participants through  common everyday tasks and exercises while outfitted with patented devices that  altered their senses.  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>November and December 2016</em><br>
  The VDT clinical nurse training  began on November 1, 2016. This was a hospital-wide initiative, with a total of  224 participants attending the 12 sessions and experiencing the Virtual  Dementia Tour.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tour allowed clinical  nurses to experience firsthand what a dementia patient experiences. During the  debriefing after the tour, the participants were asked how they were going to  change their practice in caring not only for patients with dementia, but for  all patients on the unit.  The practice  changes included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Giving the patient  ample time patient to respond to a task</li>
  <li>Using a caring touch</li>
  <li>Cutting down on noise  and distraction</li>
  <li>Redirecting the patient  when they exhibit aggressive behavior</li>
  <li>Allowing the patient to  lead the care</li>
  <li>Giving the patient  choices rather than directing them what to do</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This program was  designed to help nurses change the way they provide care for patients with  dementia, and all patients on the unit, by ensuring patients&rsquo; perspectives and  preferences are included in the plan of care.</p>

<p><strong>Example Two: Improving  Skin Care and Preventing HAPUs </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  In December 2014, after the fourth quarter NDNQI pressure ulcer  prevalence survey was completed, Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Vice  President and Chief Nursing Officer, reviewed the nurse-sensitive data on  pressure ulcers and noted that Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BPG) was above the Magnet  mean for Percent of Surveyed Patients with Hospital-Acquired Pressure Ulcers (HAPU)  Stage II and above. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stewart identified through her review of the data that 1.50% of patients  had a HAPU stage II or above in third quarter 2014, and that this had increased  to 2.00% in fourth quarter 2014.Stewart therefore scheduled a meeting with Renee  Mende, BSN, RN, CWOCN, Inpatient Wound Care clinical nurse, to discuss the  results of the previous two pressure ulcer prevalence surveys.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mende told Stewart of her concern that not all pressure ulcers had been  hospital-acquired. She believed that some patients were arriving with a  pressure ulcer but that there was inconsistent documentation of the four-eyed  assessment and of wounds on admission. If the patient arrives with a wound but  this is not documented in the electronic medical record, it i counted as a HAPU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mende said she would research resources from the Wound, Ostomy and  Continence Nurses (WOCN) Society and determine best practices for preventing  pressure ulcers.  Mende is an active  member of the WOCN Society, is certified as a Wound Ostomy Clinical Nurse and  keeps up to date on knowledge about all aspect of wound care by, for example,  attending conferences. (Wound care nurses also are employed in the Outpatient  Wound Care Center.) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another NDNQI pressure ulcer prevalence survey was conducted in March  2015; 2.86% of patients had a HAPU stage II or above, compared to the NDNQI mean  benchmark of 1.32%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal Statement</strong><br>
  To decrease the percentage of patients with a hospital-acquired pressure  ulcers stage II or above, measured through quarterly prevalence surveys and  reported to NDNQI. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description of the  Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  <em>April 2015</em><br>
  The Fact Sheet written by the Professional Practice Committee of the WOCN  Society outlines the role of the wound care nurse. It states the wound care  nurse should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide formal education to all levels of staff</li>
  <li>Incorporate evidence-based practice into the care of  the patient</li>
  <li>Serve as a clinical expert on wound care</li>
  <li>Participate in outcome evaluation including NDNQI  pressure ulcer prevalence survey</li>
  <li>Benchmark with other organizations</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mende reviewed the website of her professional organization, the WOCN  Society, to determine best practices for preventing HAPUs. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Performing a comprehensive skin assessment, including  four-eyed assessment, on admission and transfer</li>
  <li>Using a standardized pressure ulcer risk assessment</li>
  <li>Care planning and implementation to address areas of  risk</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>May 2015</em><br>
  Based on the information from the WOCN Society, Mende met with Debra  Briske, MSN, RN, CEN, Clinical Nurse Specialist, Nursing Education, and Deborah  Schroeder, BSN, RN, CGRN, Education Specialist, Nursing Education, to develop a  plan for providing inpatient clinical nurses with education on pressure ulcer  prevention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mende, Briske and Schroeder decided that a two-part education series  would improve clinical nurses&rsquo; knowledge and determined that the RN Education  Sessions would be the perfect venue to provide this education. The RN Education  Sessions are held four to five times a year for three hours to update clinical  nurses on existing and new policy issues, provide education on new products and  address any issues deemed critical by the nursing leadership team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The education program would be in two parts. The June 2015 session would  provide a brief overview of pressure ulcers and review a case study of a  patient who developed a HAPU at BGP, and the August 2015 session would be an  in-depth program regarding pressure ulcers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late May 2015, the outline of the program was reviewed with Pam  Lively, BSN, RN, Assistant Nurse Manager, 2 South, and Sue Wolka, BSN, RN,  Assistant Nurse Manager, CCSU, who agreed that the program would be  beneficial.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>June-July 2015</em><br>
  RN Education Sessions were held on the following days:</p>
<ul>
  
    <li>Monday, June 22, 2015 – 3 sessions</li>
    <li>Thursday, June 25, 2015 – 3 sessions</li>
    <li>Friday, June 26, 2015 – 3 sessions</li>
    <li>Monday, June 29, 2015 –3 sessions</li>
    <li>Tuesday, June 30, 2015 – 3 sessions</li>
    <li>Wednesday, July 1, 2015 – 3 sessions</li>
    <li>Thursday, July 2, 2015 – 1 session</li>
  
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The agenda consisted of an introduction to new trends in pressure ulcers,  a review of a case study and an introduction to the August education sessions  at which wound care would be studied further. More than 210 clinical nurses  attended the June/July education sessions. It was also announced that BGP is  always looking for new clinical nurses to be part of the NDNQI Pressure Ulcer  Team, and two clinical nurses signed up to be part of the team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>August-September 2015 </em><br>
  Mende, with the assistance of Briske and Schroeder, provided pressure ulcer  education to clinical nurses during the August education sessions. It was  important that Mende teach all sessions based on the WOCN Society&rsquo;s recommendation  that the wound care nurse serves as a clinical expert in wound care. The  sessions were held on the following days:</p>
<ul>
  
    <li>Friday, August 21, 2015 – 2 sessions</li>
    <li>Monday, August 24, 2015 – 2 sessions</li>
    <li>Monday, August 31, 2015 – 2 sessions</li>
    <li>Wednesday, September 2, 2015 – 1 session</li>
  
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The education sessions consisted of two parts:</p>
<ul>
  
    <li>Lecture: &ldquo;Must knows&rdquo; about pressure ulcers, wound  and skin injuries: Risk factors, prevention, identification and treatment - 0.5  contact hour</li>
    <li>Hands on Skill: Wound Care Fair - 1.0 contact hour</li>
  </ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objectives of the program were to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify patients at risk for pressure ulcers and  other skin injuries</li>
  <li>List basic principles of wound prevention and  maintenance of healthy skin tissue</li>
  <li>Classify pressure ulcer stages and identify other  skin injuries</li>
  <li>Name appropriate interventions to prevent pressure  ulcers and other skin injuries</li>
  <li>Name appropriate initial treatment therapy for  pressure ulcers and other skin injuries.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Wound Care Fair consisted of three stations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name that wound</li>
  <li>Pressure Ulcer Prevention, Support Surfaces &amp; Documentation</li>
  <li>Treatment options/Choosing a Wound Care Product.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the program, the nurses were expected to incorporate the knowledge  they learned in the program to assist in preventing pressure ulcers. They were  expected to perform the four-eyed assessment on all admissions and transfers,  incorporate prevention strategies into their practice and begin using the  correct products for pressure ulcers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program was well received by the more than 200 clinical nurses who  attended.  </p>
