<p><strong><em>Clinical  nurses are involved in interprofessional decision-making groups at the  organizational level. </em></strong><em>(Examples include,  but are not limited to, organizational quality<strong> </strong>councils, budget review  committees, equipment selection committees, mortality and morbidity<strong> </strong>committees,  pharmacy and therapeutics committees, blood utilization committees, safety<strong> </strong>committees,  and bioethics committees.)</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p><em>Provide two examples,  with supporting evidence, of improvements resulting from the contributions of  clinical nurses in interprofessional decision-making groups at the  organizational level. Supporting evidence must be submitted in the form of a  graph with a data table that clearly displays the data.</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: Improving Emergency Center Flow –  Emergency Center to Inpatient Flow Team</strong><br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  Patient volume in the Emergency Center  (EC) at Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) has been steadily increasing, which has  resulted in several challenges including prolonged lengths of stay for  patients. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data on length of stay (LOS) is gathered and is  part of the EC Core Measures. Core Measure data is used by the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) for the Value-Based Purchasing Program, which has a  financial impact on the hospital. Core Measures are also performance measures required  by The Joint Commission. EC Core Measure data on LOS is broken down into smaller data points including: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Arrival to admission </li>
  <li>Arrival to doctor </li>
  <li>Admission decision to departure  for admitted patients</li>
  <li>Arrival to discharge  for patients being discharged from the EC</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A multidisciplinary team of hospital leaders had  formed a task force in late 2013 to discuss issues in patient throughput,  particularly in regard to patients being admitted from the EC when there is a  critical shortage of beds in the hospital. This task force examined the EC Core  Measure data for LOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March 2015, Chris Stesney-Ridenour,  MBA, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, met with Anne Stewart, MBA,  BSN, RN, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer, and Wendy Jolley,  BSN, RN, Director of Emergency Center, to discuss the holding of EC patients,  bed management and admitting practices. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many processes and work flows were  identified as contributing to prolonged LOS in the EC. Jolley presented the  issue of prolonged wait times to Steve Apigo, BSN, RN, Administrative Manager,  Emergency Center, and Charlotta Marion, RN, Assistant Nurse Manager. Apigo and  Marion looked closely at each data point to identify areas with the greatest  opportunity for improvement; these included the time it takes to admit and  discharge patients.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They decided to focus on admitted patients and  examined the following data: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Door to doctor </li>
  <li>Door to diagnostics </li>
  <li>Door to results</li>
  <li>Door to admission  decision</li>
  <li>Admission decision to  departure </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After  examining the data, they determined that the greatest opportunity for decreasing  LOS was in the time from admit decision to departure from the EC. EC leaders  requested input from the EC charge nurses and clinical nurses Beverly Gandolfi,  RN; Joan Shimko, BSN, RN, CEN; and Sundara Ganti, BSN, RN, and they began to  examine barriers to the patient being admitted to the inpatient unit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apigo  completed a literature search to obtain information on ways to reduce LOS, and EC  leaders contacted other ECs in the Beaumont Health system to determine best  practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July  2015, Theresa Ledesma, a project manager for Beaumont Health, was invited to  BGP to assist with the project. Ledesma met with Stewart, Jolley and Kristen Cavender,  BSIE, MBA, CSSBB, Administrative Director. Ledesma had been working with the  team at Beaumont Trenton to decrease its overall LOS. Ledesma, Jolley, Apigo  and Marion visited Beaumont Trenton, which had shown progress in decreasing  LOS, to examine its processes for patient throughput. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jolley,  Apigo and Marion discussed the processes in place at Trenton with EC clinical nurses  at BGP. Apigo, Marion and clinical nurses Thomas Difilippo, BSN, RN; Anna Welch,  BSN, RN; and Alfonso Flores, BSN, RN then made visits to Trenton to observe the  patient flow and processes of the Emergency Department. Discussions were held  with the EC clinical nurses to solicit their input into which processes may  work at BGP.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July 2015, EC data showed a time of 109  minutes between decision to admit and time of departure. The goal for this Core  Measure was 60 minutes. Multiple discussions about the causes of delays were  held with EC clinical nurses, who identified the following factors contributing  to delays in transferring patients to an inpatient bed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Incomplete testing  and/or results </li>
  <li>Need for the clinical nurse  to complete care </li>
  <li>Waiting  for the Emergency Center physician to enter inpatient orders</li>
  <li>Transfer  and/or discharge of patients from inpatient beds </li>
  <li>Delay  in cleaning empty inpatient beds </li>
  <li>Delays  in central transport</li>
  <li>Difficulty in EC nurse  to inpatient nurse handoff</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was  clear that it would take a multidisciplinary team to develop an improvement  plan. The improvement process focused on the metric of decision to admit time  to time of departure. </p>
<p>In July  2015, an administrative decision was made to have a system-level project  manager assist with a process improvement plan to decrease the amount of time  between physician decision to admit and patient departure from the EC. In  August 2015, Ledesma was assigned to be the project manager for the process  improvement plan at BGP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because  of the quality and financial impact of this issue on BGP, this organization-wide  decision-making group was formed for the sole purpose of decreasing the time it  takes for patients to leave the EC once an order is written. The directive from  Chris Stesney-Ridenour, MBA, Vice  President and Chief Operating Officer, was to develop a process for  implementing the necessary steps to decrease the turnaround time. The team was  expected to periodically report its progress to the administrative team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement </strong> <br>
  To decrease the amount of time, in minutes, from  decision to admit to the time of departure for patients in the Emergency  Center. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities </strong><br>
  <em>August 2015 </em><br>
  An initial kickoff meeting was held with an interprofessional  team that included EC clinical nurses, inpatient clinical nurses, and  representatives from hospital administration, nursing leadership, Medical  Services, Care Management, Registration, Transportation Services and the  Nursing Business Office. This team, called the Emergency  Center to Inpatient Flow Team, was led by Project Manager  Ledesma and had the overall objective to &ldquo;improve bed placement turnaround  times for EC to IP patients to be placed in an inpatient bed within one hour  from the time the admit order was received.&rdquo; The specific goal was to decrease  the time, in minutes, from decision to admit to the time  of departure for patients in the Emergency Center  <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team charter that was developed included  frequency of meetings, expectations, commitment and timelines. Process  Improvement (PI) methodology was described to clinical nurses for both the EC  and the inpatient stakeholders. This organization-wide decision-making group  was given the authority to implement strategies to decrease the time patients  spend in the EC after an admit order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>September 2015 </em></p>
<ul>
  <li>September 14, 2015: Jolley submitted an IT request for the development  of detailed reports. Jolley wanted reports available in Epic to track internal  metrics, Core Measures and turnaround times. This report would be used to note  any reduction in the LOS in the department, assist with patient flow and  increase customer satisfaction.</li>
  <li>September 15, 2015: A meeting was held to review and agree on the team  members and to review and modify the current state map and begin identifying  any barriers. The current state map is the process that is currently being used.</li>
  <li>September 22, 2015: A team meeting was held, including clinical nurses,  to begin looking at barriers and how to get to the optimal state. The interprofessional  group discussed the barriers of each scope of practice or discipline, and a process  map of ways to implement changes and remove barriers. Clinical nurses provided  feedback about the effect these changes would have on their work flow. The team  understood that there would have to be buy-in from several other groups,  including IT and physicians. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>October 2015</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>October 13, 2015: The EC clinical nurses addressed the issue of  overcrowding in the EC; when the EC was overcrowded it became backed up, which  increased the time from admit to leaving the EC. The interprofessional team  reconvened to discuss creating and implementing a surge plan, which would  consist of action steps to be taken in the event of overcrowding in the EC. The  surge plan was a page sent to all inpatient nursing leaders and leaders from  administration, Dietary, Transportation and Environmental Services. Under the  surge plan, all inpatient clinical nurses would place a priority on discharging  patients and transferring admitted patients across inpatient units. Another  issue that the clinical nurses discussed was the physicians&rsquo; work flow, which  the nurses believed sometimes caused backups.</li>
  <li>October 20, 2015: Glen Clark, MD, Medical Director of the EC, began to  attend the Flow Team&rsquo;s meetings based on the suggestions that an Emergency  Center physician (ECP) should be includedto provide ECP practice and feedback. Deb Briske, MSN, RN, CEN, Clinical  Nurse Specialist, Nursing Education, and Sandra Rizzo, MSN, RN, CEN, Clinical Nurse  Specialist, Emergency Center, were also included on the team to begin a plan  for the roll out of education for the project. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>November 2015  </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>November 10, 2015: Rose Miszkowski, MSW, Director of Patient Registration,  and Stesney-Ridenour discussed adding a pre-admit button to the BGP track  board, which identifies the status of the patient. This pre-admit button would  enable ECPs to pre-admit patients electronically, which would enable Bed  Management to clinically review the patient&rsquo;s chart with Care Management and  assign beds proactively. This process would assist in prioritizing clean bed  assignments, with the intention of decreasing the admit time to bed assignment  and bed assignment to departure.</li>
  <li>November 12, 2-15- Stesney-Ridnour convened a special meeting to  discuss employee roles in the new process, including how to coordinate work  flows between all departments. Each professional group was given a role and  responsibility for the project: 
    <ul>
      <li>EC physicians: Use the &ldquo;pre-admit&rdquo; function in Epic. </li>
      <li>Attending physicians: Facilitate timely discharge and transfer of  patients.</li>
      <li>Care Management: Look at the &ldquo;pre-admit&rdquo; patients and proactively work  on bed assignments.</li>
      <li>Bed Management: Use the RN Care Managers for proper placement of  patients. Inform Environmental Services of priority beds to clean. Page the  inpatient RN to inform of pending admission. </li>
      <li>Unit Secretary: Use the transport &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; in the bed tracking  system. Follow up with transport if the patient is not moved after 15 minutes,  place a &ldquo;courtesy call&rdquo; to inpatient floor informing them the patient is on  their way. </li>
      <li>EC RN: Make certain admitted patient is ready to go within 20 minutes. </li>
      <li>EC Charge RN: Find alternative transportation resource if necessary. </li>
      <li>Inpatient RN: Monitor transfers and discharges for timeliness. Follow  bed ahead practice and assign nurses proactively. Check Epic when assigned a  patient and facilitate transfers. </li>
      <li>Environmental Services: Use stat bed cleaning per protocol. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>December 2015</em><br>
  The last step  was to educate the ECPs on the new process. Clark provided communication and  follow up on the use of the pre-admit function in Epic, and this was reinforced  at monthly provider meetings and through daily spot monitoring. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pilot of the  new process began at 0700 on December 21, 2015. The pilot lasted for  approximately two weeks without any changes, and the entire process was fully  implemented by December 31, 2015.EC  leadership as well as Ledesma, Project Manager, were on the units to provide  support for the EC and inpatient team. Unit secretaries began the new process  of placing patients in the transport tracker for a 20-minute appointment time.</p>

<p><strong>Outcomes</strong><br>
  Clinical nurses&rsquo; involvement in the organization-level  Emergency Center to Inpatient Flow Team resulted in an improvement in  disposition of patients with an admission order. After the implementation of  the new admit flow process, the time from decision to admit to time of  departure for patients in the Emergency Center decreased from 111 minutes in  August 2015 to 85 minutes in January 2016, 87 minutes in February 2016 and 85  minutes in March 2016.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Example  Two: Improving Beaumont Grosse Pointe&rsquo;s Press Ganey Overall Rating</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) uses Press Ganey as its  vendor to monitor HCAHPS survey results, which provide it with valuable information  on how customers perceive the quality of care they received. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BGP is part of Beaumont Health, an eight-hospital  system in the Detroit area. HCAHPS scores at Beaumont Health are monitored weekly,  monthly and yearly. BGP receives Press Ganey HCAHPS scores weekly to gage how  the monthly scores will be reported.  The  reports are presented outlining each HCAHPS dimension at the hospital level and  by inpatient nursing unit. Each dimension is presented separately and depicted  in different colors. If the score is above the target the box is green, and if  the score is below the target the box is red. The targets are based on the  percentile ranking for the All Press Ganey database.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The target for 2015 was set at the 62nd  percentile ranking, meaning each dimension must achieve a 62nd  percentile ranking to meet the target. The targets are adjusted yearly based on  how well BGP performed. No targets are set below the 50th percentile  ranking.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rick Swaine, MBA, MSF, CPA, Hospital President,  monitors the scores weekly and reviews them during Beaumont Health&rsquo;s presidents  meeting. Swaine believes that the question about the &ldquo;Overall Rating&rdquo; of the  hospital has an impact on all other questions and drive the scores. The  question that is asked is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;Using any number from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worse hospital possible  and 10 is the best hospital possible, what number would you use to rate this  hospital during your stay?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hospital is scored based on the number of  ratings of 9 or 10 that are achieved. BGP&rsquo;s year-end 2014 score for Overall Rating  was in the 49th percentile, meaning it did not meet the target. In  March 2015, this ranking fell to the 46th percentile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In early April 2015, with scores inconsistent, Swaine  determined that something needed to be changed to improve the Overall Rating of  the hospital. Swaine called a meeting with Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC,  Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer; Kristen Cavender, BSIE, MBA, CSSBB,  Administrative Director; and Mary Kay Blaine, Manager of Service Excellence, to  discuss ways to improve this score.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To improve the percentile ranking of Beaumont Grosse  Pointe&rsquo;s Press Ganey HCAHPS score for the hospital&rsquo;s Overall Rating. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities </strong><br>
  <em>April 2015</em><br>
  </p>
<p>A meeting was held to review the Press Ganey scores  with BGP&rsquo;s nursing leaders and begin to develop a plan to improve them, particularly  the score for Overall Rating.  The nurse  leaders in attendance were Marie Reinman, RN, Director Critical Care and Heart  and Vascular; Linda Witt, MA, BSN, RN, ONC, Director Surgical Services; and Wendy  Jolley, BSN, RN, Director Emergency Center. During this first meeting they  quickly decided that, to be effective, the group need representation from  across the organization, including other hospital leaders as well as clinical  staff, especially clinical nurses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>May 2015</em><br>
  Meetings were held in May 2015 with various leaders,  clinical nurses and clinical staff to determine the best way to increase  scores. During one meeting, Kelly Adams, MSN, RN, Assistant Nurse Manager,  Critical Care; Patricia Heitz, RN, Assistant Nurse Manager, Family Birth Center;  and Cindy Gregorich, MSA, BSN, RN, Manager, Care Management discussed holding a  weekly meeting for all hospital leaders and clinical nurses to discuss scores  and develop ways to improve them.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everyone thought this was a great idea, and plans  were made to have the first meeting in June 2015. The newly formed  organization-level Customer Service meeting would be structured in a way that all  members, including clinical nurses, would give suggestions about how to improve  care on the unit and raise any issues that might be affecting the way they  provide care. The clinical nurses were crucial to the success of these meetings,  as they are the ones at the bedside and thus able to see the issues that have  the greatest affect on patient care. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Customer Service group was empowered as a  decision-making group. Once an issue was identified, an owner would be  designated and it was expected that the issue would be resolved. The owner of  the outstanding issue would be responsible for reporting on progress toward  resolving it at the next weekly meeting.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>June 2015</em><br>
  The first Customer Service meeting was held on June  2, 2015 with more than 35 leaders, clinical nurses and other members in attendance.  Clinical nurses were asked about what was interfering in providing excellent  nursing care. With the input of the clinical nurses, the team identified and  prioritized the most important items and identified solutions to be  implemented.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are only some of the decisions that were made  based on the contribution of the clinical nurses in the Customer Service meeting.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>July-August 2015</em><br>
  The weekly meeting continued, and clinical nurses  worked with other members of the team to identify ways to improve the care of  the patients at BGP. </p>
