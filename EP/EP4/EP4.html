<p><strong><em>Nurses  create partnerships with patients and families to establish goals and plans for  delivery of patient-centered care.</em></strong></p>

  <strong>AND</strong></em></li>
 <li><em>Provide one example,  with supporting evidence, of nurses partnering with patients and families to  improve systems of care at the unit, service line or organizational level. </em></li>

 </ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  One: Individualized Plan of Care Based on the Unique Needs of a Patient </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good outcomes  are&nbsp;not&nbsp;always&nbsp;easy to achieve. For patients with compromised  physical, mental, emotional and environmental needs, the nurse must partner  with the patient, family and care team to create an individualized Plan of Care  to meet the patient&rsquo;s complex needs.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One example of nurses  partnering with a patient with unique needs began in August 2015 when A.H. made  her first visit to the Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) Emergency Center (EC) to  receive care. A.H. is a 19-year-old woman with  chronic type I diabetes and myriad other health issues that require her to keep  a strict medication and diet regimen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since August 2015,  A.H. has had 43 admissions to BGP with lengths of stay ranging from two to  seven days. She typically presents herself to the EC in a crisis seeking  admission. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Complex and Unique Needs </strong><br>
  A.H.&nbsp;presented  to BGP with an extensive and unique medical history. Her medical diagnoses were  as follows (the dates below are when the diagnoses were first made): </p>

<p align="center">EP4,  Diagnoses of A.H.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A.H. was first  admitted to BGP on August 8, 2015 with a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).  She was admitted to the Critical Care Unit (CCU) for treatment and was  discharged on August 10, 2015, only to return to the EC on August 12,  2015 and be readmitted to CCU with the same diagnosis<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her admissions  continued monthly, and sometimes more frequently, for more than a year. The  most common diagnosis was abdominal pain secondary to DKA. Non-compliant  diabetic activity opens the patient up to many different comorbidities. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP4-1.pdf">(Evidence  EP4-1, Screen Shots of A.H. Admission)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the many diagnoses and  admissions of this young patient, A.H. has many unique needs to be addressed,  including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Education  on the disease process</li>
  <li>Individualized  plan to prevent hospital admission</li>
  <li>Individualized  home care services</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Partnering  with the Patient and Family </strong><br>
  One example of a partnership  with the patient comes from November 4, 2016, when Holly  Cory, RN, CCM, Nurse Care Manager, met with A.H. to discuss her visit to a new physician  and the possibility of getting an insulin pump that her insurance would cover.  A.H. explained to Cory that she believed the  visits were helping her understand and cope with her diabetes. Cory partnered  with A.H. to obtain the equipment that was required to ensure she was receiving  the proper care. The plan was to find an insulin pump that her insurance would  cover. A.H. informed Cory that, as part of her  Plan of Care, she would continue to follow up with the new physician every Wednesday  until Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On November 10, 2016, during  one of her frequent admissions, a multidisciplinary meeting was led by Mark  Alrais, MD, the patient&rsquo;s primary provider. The purpose of the meeting was to partner  with A.H. and her family to develop an individualized  care plan for A.H. moving forward. The following care team members were  present:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A.H., the patient</li>
  <li>Cherie Cusimano, BSN, RN, clinical nurse, 3 West</li>
  <li>Holly Cory, RN, CCM, Care Manager </li>
  <li>Christie Hoffman, RN-BC, Charge Nurse, 3 West</li>
  <li>Patricia Ackley, BSN, RN, Administrative Manager, 3 West</li>
  <li>Leanna Beattie, LMSW, Social Worker</li>
  <li>Michael Brennan, DO, Consultant Physician</li>
  <li>Mark Alrais, MD, Primary Care Physician</li>
  <li>The patient&rsquo;s mother</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alrais reviewed the status of  A.H.&rsquo;s medical condition with all present. He explained the seriousness of her  disease, why what she was doing was not  improving her health and the importance of following her Plan of Care. A.H.  agreed to the Plan of Care that was discussed: to better adhere to the medical  regimen, try to avoid behaviors that were preventing a better outcome and follow  up on recommendations.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On April 5, 2017, Cory continued  to partner with A.H. to discuss post-discharge care.  Cory explained to A.H. the importance of  follow-up care post-hospitalization, stressing the importance of answering the  phone when the home care nurse was calling. Cory explained that A.H. needed to  be responsible for her care, and A.H. agreed that she would work with the home  care team. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On April 6, 2017, Cory again  partnered with A.H. regarding her home care, as based on their conversation  from April 5 she was not confident that A.H. would follow up with home care. During  the conservation on April 5, Cory had explained to A.H. that she needed to  answer the phone when the home care nurse called to make an appointment for her  to receive the IV therapy. A.H. agreed that she would comply with Cory&rsquo;s  instruction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cory suggested that A.H. go to  an infusion center to receive the prescribed antibiotic treatment to assist  with her recovery. Cory told A.H. that she would arrange transportation from  her insurance carrier to get her to the infusion center: They would pick her up  at her home, take her to the infusion center and return her to her home after the  treatment. After careful consideration, A.H. requested that she receive the  treatment in her home rather than going to the infusion center. Cory agreed to  continue to support A.H. with her expressed preference. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During A.H.s&rsquo; June 14, 2017  hospital visit, Jacquelyn Bowness, BSN, RN, clinical nurse, 3 West, explained  to the patient the importance of following her diet when A.H. wanted to order  pizza from a local restaurant. To help A.H. adhere to her prescribed Plan of Care,  Bowness partnered with A.H. to discuss her food choice and help her understand  the need to make better decisions about her diet. After this discussion, A.H.  agreed that she would not order food from the outside and would obtain meals  only from the dietary department. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP4-2.pdf">(Evidence EP4-2, Electronic Medical Record from Multidisciplinary  Meeting and Screen Shot of Electronic Medical Records)</a>   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Individualized Care for the Patient </strong><br>
  It was apparent  that A.H. required an individualized Plan of Care to manage her multiple  diagnoses and care requirements. Examples of individualized care include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Admit to consistent unit for all admissions</li>
  <li>Consistent Nurse Care Manager</li>
  <li>Education and individualized care</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Admit to Consistent Unit</em><br>
  During one of A.H.s&rsquo;  admissions in March 2016, 3  West clinical nurses approached Patricia Ackley, BSN,  RN, Administrative Manager, 3 West, regarding the chronic lack of outpatient  follow-up in the care of A.H. They suggested that an ethics consult be ordered  to assist with A.H.&rsquo;s care and that an individualized Plan of Care be  developed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An ethics consult  was completed on November 3, 2016 with Edward Neumaier, BSN, CHPCN, Palliative  Care Coordinator. After meeting with the patient, Neumaier met with the  clinical nurse and Ackley to assist in developing a mutually agreed upon Plan of Care with follow-up. Neumaier believed that  providing consistent care to A.H. would assist in following up on the Plan of Care,  and that having the same clinical nurses and Nurse Care Manager care for  A.H. would build relationships and help her partner with the clinical staff to  follow her Plan of Care. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP4-3.pdf">(Evidence  EP4-3, Ethics Consult)</a> After the intake  note was completed, the ethics consult was cancelled because the physician was  going to have a family meeting with the patient, her mother and the clinical  staff. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If&nbsp;A.H. were  to require a higher level of care,&nbsp;the admitting department was aware that  she should return to her&nbsp;home unit when medical/surgical care was  warranted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Consistent Nurse Care Manager</em><br>
  In November 2016,a consistent Nurse Care Manager was  assigned to A.H. to provide individualized  care. It was believed that this arrangement would  assist in providing consistent care to the patient. <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November 2016,Cory spoke about  this case with Deborah Klein, LMSW, ACUS, Director of Care Management, and they  decided to assign the patient to the same Nurse Care Manager and Social Worker for  continuity of care. Cory spoke with A.H.&rsquo;s long-term case manager at Molina  Health to advise her of the Plan of Care. Klein also spoke with the home care  clinical nurse to gain insight into the patient&rsquo;s home situation from a nursing  perspective. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP4-4.pdf">(Evidence  EP4-4, Electronic Medical Record for Cory) </a></p>
<a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP4-4.pdf"></a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once this plan was  established, the care team was quick to review the Plan of Care and ensure that  consults were placed appropriately and in a timely manner. Care Management and the  Social Worker were notified of the patient&rsquo;s admission. Clinical nurses and the  Care Manager conducted progressive rounds daily to reestablish the patient's  individualized Plan of Care.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This individualized  Plan of Care to assign A.H. to one nursing unit and one Nurse Care Manager helped clinical  nurses and ancillary services provide the patient and family with the best care  possible. This partnership between nurses and the patient would develop a relationship with the clinical  nurses and Nurse Care Manager, and the staff would also develop a relationship  with the patient. The patient said this was a great idea. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Education and Individualized Plan of Care</em><br>
  Based on the family  meeting on November 10, 2016, a detailed individualized Plan of Care was  established. The following were agreed to by the patient, family and care team:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Importance of compliance with medications and diet. </li>
  <li>Plans for follow-up at the Gastrointestinal Center at Beaumont  Royal Oak for more advanced therapies. </li>
  <li>An insulin pump was discussed, and application paperwork for an  insulin pump was given to the patient. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other examples of  individualized care include clinical nurses providing education on the insulin  pump on February 19, 2017. The clinical nurses identified that A.H. was having  multiple issues using the pump.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 8, 2017,  Susan Notoriano, RN, clinical nurse, 3 West, believed that A.H. could use help  with relaxation. A. H.  agreed with her recommendation, so Notoriano taught the patient relaxation  techniques and provided individualized care  addressing exercise, carbohydrates and the effect of insulin. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the multidisciplinary  meeting in November 2016, A.H. has been admitted to BGP 13 times, each time  continuing with the individualized Plan of Care that had been outlined earlier.  A.H. was admitted to 3 West and had the same Nurse Care Manager. The clinical  nurse continued to provide education and reinforce the education on A.H.&rsquo;s diabetes  and kidney issues.<a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP4-5.pdf">(Evidence  EP4-5, Electronic Medical Records Notes and Care Plan Notes for A.H.</a>) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although A.H. remains a  challenging patient with unique needs, the clinical nurses of BGP continue to  partner with her to help her manage her many care needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Two: Partnering with a Patient and  Family to Improve the Care in the Emergency Center</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Care Provided in the Emergency Center</strong> <br>
  On June 26, 2016, A.Z. arrived at the Beaumont  Grosse Pointe (BGP) Emergency Center (EC) verbalizing abdominal cramping and  vaginal bleeding. This patient was 16 weeks pregnant upon arrival. After the  initial pelvic exam performed by an EC mid-level provider, A.Z. was ordered an  ultrasound. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the ultrasound, the fetus passed out of  the uterus and into the vaginal canal. Subsequent ultrasounds indicated an  empty uterus with irregular endometrium. The ultrasound technician reported to  the EC that the fetus had passed out of the uterus. Upon returning to the EC,  the patient was placed in a private room and the fetus was removed from the  vagina by the physician assistant. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On June 27, 2016, the patient&rsquo;s mother  called the hospital to express concerns about her daughter&rsquo;s care, saying that  the clinical nurses and physician assistant had &ldquo;no empathy toward her daughter.&rdquo;  She further explained that she was not happy that her daughter had waited  approximately 30 minutes before a medical exam was performed. The patient&rsquo;s  mother was also not satisfied with the lack of emotional support for her  daughter following the perinatal loss. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Apigo, BSN, RN, Director of  Emergency Center, was notified of the mother&rsquo;s concern regarding the care. Apigo  then notified Glen Clark, MD, Chief, Emergency Center; Maureen Bennett, Service  Excellence; and Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief  Nursing Officer. Bennett suggested that a stakeholders meeting be held to  review the care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Discussion  of Care </strong><br>
  A meeting was called to discuss the care  of the patient and family in the Emergency Center. The following staff members  were in attendance: </p>

<p align="center">EP4, Care  Improvement Participants </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  participants reviewed the case, and Clark determined that the medical care and  the care in the ultrasound department had been appropriate. Apigo reviewed the  electronic medical record and had a discussion with the EC clinical nurses who  had been involved in the patient&rsquo;s care. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP4-6.pdf">(Evidence EP4-6, Timeline of Care in EC)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After  reviewing the medical record and discussing the case with the clinical nurses,  it was determined that the hospital&rsquo;s policy was followed in the care of the  patient and of the fetus. However, elements of the process involving the  emotional care of the patient had been omitted. The following aspects of  hospital policy had not been followed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wrap fetus in blanket</li>
  <li>Notify OB</li>
  <li>Notify Spiritual  Services</li>
  <li>Clean infant; allow patients  to assist</li>
  <li>Give family opportunity  to hold fetus</li>
  <li>Give family opportunity  to name baby</li>
  <li>Take pictures of fetus  with parents&rsquo; consent</li>
  <li>Prepare mementos if  possible  </li>
  <li>Give all  photos/mementos to parents prior to discharge: do not store any copies </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the patient was discharged, she and her  mother told Marion that they would like to arrange to pick up the fetus so they  could have a funeral. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On June 27, 2016, Marion met with the Pathology  department and prepared for the family to pick up the fetus. After making the  necessary arrangements, Marion notified the family that they could pick up the  fetus, and a funeral was planned by the family. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Partnering with the Patient  and Family to Improve the System of Care</strong><br>
  Bennett contacted the family to express  condolences on behalf of BGP and offer them the opportunity to come to the  hospital to share their concerns with hospital staff members and identify ways  to improve the care in the Emergency Center. The patient and family agreed to  partner with Emergency Center nursing on ways to improve care. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP4-8.pdf"> (Evidence EP4-8, Appointment with Hospital, Patient and Family) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On July 26, 2016, Swaine facilitated a  meeting involving nurses, a physician, and the patient and family to improve the  system of care in the EC for patients and families experiencing fetal demise.  At this meeting, the patient&rsquo;s mother reiterated her displeasure with how her  daughter&rsquo;s emotional needs were not met during her care in the EC. The patient  also expressed concerns about the care and how the fetus was referred to as a  &ldquo;specimen&rdquo; instead of a baby. The mother believed there was a lack of empathy  toward her daughter, who agreed.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The patient also said that she was not  given an opportunity to grieve over the loss of her baby, and that patients  experiencing this type of loss should have an opportunity to express their  feelings. Her intention was to advise the nurse so this does not happen to  another patient.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The patient said she would like to see  the clinical nurses in the Emergency Center better prepared to provide care for  patients with the diagnosis of fetal demise. Specifically, the patient said it  would have been helpful if clinical nurses were educated on terminology not to  use, such as &ldquo;specimen,&rdquo; when talking about the fetus. The patient and her mother  also suggested the EC take into consideration the emotions of families  experiencing perinatal loss, and that additional resources be provided for the  family. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apigo agreed with the patient and her family  that these actionable items were appropriate, and he said that a legacy plan  would be put in place for new clinical nurses hired into the EC. The family was  agreeable to this plan and was informed that an action plan would be  implemented based on their input and that they would be updated on its progress.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the meeting with the family, Apigo;  Marion; Bradley O&rsquo;Shell, BSN, RN, Assistant Nurse Manager, EC; and Sandra  Rizzo, MSN, RN, CEN, Clinical Nurse Specialist, EC, began education for  clinical nurses about the care of patients presenting to the EC with the  diagnosis of fetal demise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nurses indicated that they felt  emotionally overwhelmed by the event, but that many were not aware of every  detail of the hospital&rsquo;s policy. EC leaders met to create an action plan based  on the partnership with the patient and her family to provide education and  prepare bedside caregivers for these types of event. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rizzo was responsible for developing and  providing the education to the clinical nurses, which was done one-on-one and  in small groups. Handouts were developed to ensure the staff was providing  consistent quality care to patients who experience a perinatal loss. The  handouts were new to the staff, who agreed they were a good idea so they would  know what is expected when a patient with a perinatal loss presents to the EC.  The following were developed to assist the  staff:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Perinatal Loss  Checklist &amp; Follow-up</li>
  <li>Perinatal Loss  Identification </li>
  <li>Preparing Baby/Fetus  for Final Disposition</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Improvement in the Care </strong><br>
  As an  outcome of partnering with the patient and her family in  response to the care she had received in the EC, Rizzo met with Marisa Engel,  MSN, RNC-OB, C-EFM, Clinical Nurse Specialist, Family Birth Center, to discuss ways  to improve the care for maternity care patients in the EC. After reviewing the  incident with Engels, Rizzo implemented the following to improve the system of care:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clinical nurses were provided  education as a group and individually regarding the care of patients with fetal  demise.</li>
  <li>Clinical nurses were provided  education about how to provide emotional support for both the patient and  family.</li>
  <li>An education table was  initiated in the Emergency Center, displaying educational materials and  handouts on fetal demise for clinical nurses to review.</li>
  <li>The Fetal Demise  Educational Resource Binder was updated and made available for all to access as  a reference.</li>
  <li>Spiritual Care to be  notified of all patients admitted with fetal demise.</li>
  <li>Social Worker to be  notified of all patients admitted with fetal demise.</li>
  <li>The Perinatal Loss  Program at Beaumont Royal Oak was investigated for possible implementation at  BGP.</li>
  <li>A plan was developed to  initiate &ldquo;The Pause&rdquo; in the Emergency Center.  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pause&rdquo; is a moment of silence after a  patient's death to honor the patient after they pass away. In this case, it  would involve fetal demise. A multicultural group in the same room focuses on one  point, the patient who has passed away. They honor the patient as a group, but  doing it in silence as individuals in their own personalized way, whether in  prayer, in thinking positive thoughts or just recognizing the moment and its  importance. This process is a nurse-driven initiative in collaboration with the  patient and family. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was important that that the clinical nurses  understood the hospital policy regarding fetal demise to ensure that the  following care is provided to the patient and the family.  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Wrap fetus in blanket</li>
  <li>Clean infant; allow  patients to assist</li>
  <li>Give family opportunity  to hold fetus</li>
  <li>Give family opportunity  to name baby</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Partnering  with the patient and family enabled the EC to see what is important to the  patient and develop strategies to ensure the care is improved for patients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the education the clinical  nurses received regarding fetal demise, the improvements in the care of patients  with fetal demise were instituted. The following practice changes were made in  the EC to improve the care of patients:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Follow the Perinatal  Loss, Care of Fetus/Infant P-4 policy from the Family Birth Center in the  Emergency Center</li>
  <li>Distribute  the &ldquo;Miscarriage&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ectopic Pregnancy&rdquo; brochures to the patient</li>
  <li>Consult  to Spiritual Care</li>
  <li>Review  Disposition and Final Arrangements (Private Funeral Home, A Child Remembered  Program individual niche or A Child Remembered Program Community Internment)</li>
  <li>Complete Grief Support  Referral Form as necessary</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP4-9.pdf">(Evidence EP4-9, Checklist for Perinatal Loss, Policy P-4 Perinatal Loss, Care of Fetus/Infant,  Brochures and Grief Support Referral) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up Care for Patient </strong><br>
  A follow-up  letter was sent to the patient on July 27, 2016, updating her on how the  hospital used her suggestions and her collaboration with the clinical nurses to  improve care in the Emergency Center. In the letter she was also thanked for  her honest and open feedback about her care, which led to a partnership with the  patient and family to improve care in the Emergency Center. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP4-10.pdf">(Evidence EP4-10, Follow-up Letter  to Patient)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After  partnering with the patient and family and determining the course of action to  improve care at the system level in the EC, there have been no further issues  with patients who present in the EC for care with the diagnosis of fetal  demise.     </p>
