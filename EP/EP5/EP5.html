<h2>Care Delivery System(s) EP5</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Nurses  are involved in interprofessional collaborative practice within the care  delivery system to ensure care coordination and continuity of care.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p><em>Provide two examples,  with supporting evidence, of nurses' involvement in interprofessional  collaborative practice that ensures care coordination and continuity of patient  care.</em></p>
  </li>
  
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: Nurse  Navigator for the Congestive Heart Failure and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary  Disease Populations</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) offers a  disease-specific Nurse Navigator to assist patients and their families with  understanding and managing the disease process. The Navigator provides  consistent education to congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Education may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Disease management</li>
  <li>Nutrition information </li>
  <li>Post-discharge  follow-up  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nurse  Navigator follows patients from admission to post-discharge to continue and  reinforce teaching efforts and to ensure care coordination and continuity of patient  care after discharge from BGP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In her role as Nurse Navigator, Johanna  Castronero, BSN, RN provides consistent care coordination throughout the  continuum of care for CHF and COPD patients, their families and caregivers.  Castronero helps patients navigate the healthcare system to ensure a smooth  transition from setting to setting, and she educates patients and their  families on disease process and management of CHF and COPD. She is responsible  for communicating and collaborating with the interprofessional team to manage  patient care across the continuum. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP5-1.pdf">(Evidence EP5-1, Job Description  of Nurse Navigator)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CHF and COPD patients are given a direct phone line  to the Nurse Navigator so they and their families can contact her with any  questions they have while in the hospital or after discharge. Castronero  provides patient and family-centered education based on her assessment of the  patients&rsquo; needs.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Interprofessional  Collaborative Practice and Care Coordination Across the Continuum</strong><br>
  Castronero&rsquo;s  work with patient J.A. provides one example of her collaborative practice and  care coordination. JA is a 66-year-old male with multiple healthcare issues;  his main diagnoses are CHF, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, diabetes and coronary  artery disease.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During  J.A.&rsquo;s June 2017 admission to BGP, Castronero spoke with Georges Ghafari, MD,  Chief of Cardiology, and Cynthia Piko, MD, Internal Medicine, regarding the  case.  Castronero reviewed with Ghafari the  patient&rsquo;s history, which included multiple admissions with CHF over a short  period of time. Ghafari suggested that Castronero coordinate an appointment for  J.A. at the University of Michigan (U of M) to see someone in the heart failure  clinic, as Ghafari believed a second opinion was warranted for this gentleman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Castronero  called the University of Michigan Heart Failure and Transplant clinic and spoke  with Mary, an RN at the U of M CHF clinic. Castronero reviewed the patient  history with Mary and an appointment with a cardiologist was made for June 19,  2017 at 12:40 p.m. To assist with the coordination of care, Castronero coordinated  the transfer of the following medical records:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All DC summaries</li>
  <li>Cardiac testing</li>
  <li>Laboratory results</li>
  <li>Medication list<br>
    <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP5-2.pdf">(Evidence EP5-2, Castronero Worksheet for  JA)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On June  14, 2017, Castronero collaborated with J.A., Ghafari and Lesja Bontomsi, BSN,  RN, clinical nurse, Critical Care Stepdown Unit, to review the plan of care for  J.A. and coordinate the consult at the University of Michigan. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP5-3.pdf">(Evidence EP5-3, Screen Shot from  Electronic Medical Record, June 14, 2017) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On June  20, 2017, Castronero received a fax from Nicklas at the U of M Heart Failure  and Transplant Clinic regarding the consult with the patient to assist  Castronero, Ghafari and Piko in the continued management of the patient&rsquo;s care  at Beaumont Grosse Pointe. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP5-4.pdf">(Evidence  EP5-4, Follow-up Consult from University of Michigan)</a>  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On June  20 and 21, 2017, Castronero continued the coordination of care across the  continuum by making a discharge follow-up call to J.A. and by speaking with  Sandy at the U of M to verify that the patient had made a follow-up appointment  with Nicklas there.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Castronero  spoke with J.A. on June 20, 2017, and he said that he was not going to follow  up with Nicklas at the U of M and that he was instead going to see Ghafari and Quresh  Khairullah, MD, Director Nephrology, Beaumont Grosse Pointe. Castronero then spoke  with J.A. on June 21, 2017 to give him information about the follow-up visits  with Ghafari and Kaharullah. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP5-5.pdf">(Evidence  EP5-5, Screen Shots from Electronic Medical Record dated June 20, 2017 and June  21, 2017)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Navigator&rsquo;s  role is to continue the coordination of care with other members of the care  team to formulate optimal discharge plans for patients. A post-discharge call  is therefore made to COPD and CHF patients who agree to this, which allows for  the reassessment of the patient&rsquo;s understanding of the education provided. It  also gives the Navigator an opportunity to reinforce teaching, answer questions  and provide follow-up support/problem solving. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Two: Nurse Care  Managers Collaborate and Coordinate the Care of Patients </strong><br>
  Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) adopted a formal discharge  planning process in early 2015 as an initiative to reduce readmissions.Discharge planning begins upon  admission when patients are screened for discharge needs and the patient and  family are given education to prepare them for their journey after discharge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The care coordinators at BGP are referred to as  Nurse Care Managers (NCM). The purpose of this role is the daily organization  and facilitation of caseloads in the Emergency Center or the unit where they  are assigned. The NCMs review and evaluate the appropriateness of admission or  continued stay based on defined criteria. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main responsibilities of the NCMs include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Facilitating care  during stay, and planning and expediting plans for safe and effective  discharge.  </li>
  <li>Coordinating care across  the continuum by considering all patient needs</li>
  <li>Collaborating with the Utilization  Resource Center to obtain authorization for care and maximize reimbursement<br>
    <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP5-6.pdf">(Evidence EP5-6, Job Description of Care  Coordinator/Care Manager)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NCMs  collaborate with internal and external care providers, who include the  following:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Interprofessional  Collaborative Practice and Care Coordination</strong><br>
  NCMs practice on all units at BGP. 3 West is a  busy 45-bed medical/surgical unit with a specialty of gastrointestinal surgical  patients. To assist in the coordination of care, a morning huddle is held at 10  a.m. to facilitate smooth communication between clinical nurses and NCMs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each clinical nurse reviews their patient  assignment and updates the NCM on the nursing care plan and the concerns of the  patient and family. The NCM relays to the clinical nurse any issues or concerns  in the discharge planning process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The case of B.V., a 61-year-old female,  provides an example of an NCM collaborating and coordinating care. B.V. was  admitted on April 29, 2017 after presenting to the BGP Emergency Center with a  diagnosis of abdominal pain. Her extensive medical and surgical history  includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Depression</li>
  <li>Obesity</li>
  <li>Asthma</li>
  <li>Hernia</li>
  <li>Appendectomy</li>
  <li>Cholecystectomy</li>
  <li>Hernia repair</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initial  care management assessment of discharge needs was completed on May 1, 2017, and  NCM Sarah Griffith, BSN, RN, Nursing Care Manager, Care Management, identified  no needs at the time and the plan was for B.V. to return home. However, as her  health quickly changed the NCMs and various professionals providing care began  their collaboration and coordination of care.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 9,  2017, the patient&rsquo;s care needs had changed and at that point the plan of care  was unclear. Victoria Robinson, BSN, RN, Nurse Care Manager, Care Management,  collaborated with Larry Lloyd, MD, physician, to plan for B.V.&rsquo;s needs.  Robinson coordinated the plans to allow for home TPN.</p>
<p> .  <br>
  Robinson  also collaborated with Leanna Beattie, LMSW, Social Worker, on her recommendation about whether the patient would be  able to return home or should be admitted to a sub-acute rehabilitation facility  (SAR). <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP5-7.pdf">(Evidence EP5-7,  Screen Shots from Electronic Medical Record dated May 1, May 9 and May 11, 2017)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May  15, 2017, B.V.&rsquo;s care needs changed again and  she was transferred to the Critical Care Unit. Craig Eckenrode, BSN, RN, Nurse  Care Manager, Care Management, assumed care for B.V. The plan for B.V. at this  time was for her to be admitted to an SAR. A BGP Nurse Care Manager was  assigned to continue to follow B.V. in this new setting. Eckenrode noted that  physical and occupational therapy should be ordered once B.V. was medically  stable. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP5-8.pdf">(Evidence EP5-8,  Screen Shots from Electronic Medical Record dated May 15 and May 19, 2017)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On June  6, 2017, B.V. was transferred to 3 West, a medical/surgical unit at BGP, where  Holly Cory, RN, CCM, Nurse Care Manager, Care Management, assumed care for B.V.  Cory collaborated with Lloyd on the plan of  care, and Lloyd informed Cory that the patient would require long-term care. Cory  collaborated with social worker Beattie to determine the proper placement for  the patient to ensure that her care was coordinated and seamless.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure  the smooth transfer of care from BGP to either an SAR or long-term acute care  hospital, Cory participated in a family meeting on June 9, 2017 that included  the patient, her family, family practice residents, a physician, a social  worker, a nurse and a palliative care nurse. This interprofessional meeting was  held to discuss the status of the patient, answer the family&rsquo;s questions and coordinate  care to meet the patient and family&rsquo;s goals for care. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During  the family meeting, it was decided that a consult to Palliative Care would be  helpful. The consult was completed on June 9, 2017 by Joyce Kerdziel, BSN, RN,  Palliative Care Nurse. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP5-9.pdf">(Evidence  EP5-9, Screen Shots from Electronic Medical Record dated June 6 and June 9,  2017 and Palliative Care Consult) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On June 21, 2017, Brenda Davis, BSN, RN,  Hospice Nurse, met with the patient, her sister and brother, Beattie and Cory  to discuss the plan of care. After much discussion, collaboration and  coordination, it was decided based on the patient&rsquo;s care needs that she would go  to an extended care facility.  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP5-10.pdf">(Evidence EP5-10, Screen Shot Electronic Medical Record, Hospice Note of June  21, 2017)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure a smooth transition from the hospital  to home and to provide seamless care, the NCM is responsible for ensuring that  the patient and family are ready for discharge.   They are responsible for ordering equipment, beds and supplies (IV meds,  tube feedings, wound vacs and walkers) to ensure the family has all the  appropriate resources to care for the patient when they return to their home  setting.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also the NCMs&rsquo; responsibility to verify  benefits for medications, rehab services and home care. They also set up  discharge transportation, referrals to Social Work for extended care facility  placement and community resources such as Meals on Wheels. It is the NCMs&rsquo;  responsibility to ensure the patient and family have all the equipment needed to  provide the required care in the home.</p>
