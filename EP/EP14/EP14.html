<h2>Accountability, Competence, and Autonomy EP14</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Resources,  such as professional literature, are readily available to support  decision-making in autonomous nursing practice.</em></strong></p>
<UL>
  <LI><em>Provide two examples, with supporting evidence, of how resources are used to support evidence-based clinical decision-making in autonomous nursing practice.</em></LI>
  
</UL>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: Evidence-based Resources to  Improve Stroke Care at Beaumont Grosse Pointe</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internationally recognized research has  determined that early recognition and treatment of stroke gives patients the  best possible outcomes. Quality and timely care for patients presenting to the Beaumont  Grosse Pointe (BGP) Emergency Center (EC) with stroke symptoms relies on  several factors. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evidence-based  Research</strong><br>
  Staff members quickly performing a  clinical assessment to determine that a patient is possibly suffering a stroke  and then providing high-priority care is the key to early diagnosis, treatment  and differentiation between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the article, &ldquo;The Golden  Hour; Performing an Acute Ischemic Stroke Workup&rdquo; by J. Anderson in the journal  The Nurse Practitioner, appropriate evaluation and treatment with IV  fibrinolysis therapy can make a critical difference between independence and  disability. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP14-1.pdf">(Evidence EP14-1,  Article The Golden Hour, Performing an Acute Ischemic Stroke Workup)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Resources  Used</strong><br>
  To improve the overall response time to  the care and treatment of possible stoke patients, clinical nurses in the EC at  BPG worked closely with Cathleen Solecki, MSN, RN-BC, CCRN, CNRN, Stroke Coordinator,  and the Stroke Team made up of clinical nurses from throughout BGP, to develop  processes for improvement. EC clinical nurses used the Beaumont Clinical  Practice Guidelines as a resource to establish processes and protocols to  ensure rapid triage with a fast assessment of clinical symptoms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BGP developed an Emergency Center and In-House  Acute Stroke Algorithm that outlines the protocol to follow when working with  an acute possible stroke patient. The algorithm outlines the care that should  be completed when the patient is first identified as a stroke patient. The  algorithm outlines the following steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Within 5 minutes make  initial assessment based on last know well</li>
  <li>Within 10 minutes  physician must see patient</li>
  <li>Within 15 minutes code  stroke is called</li>
  <li>Within 25 minutes  patient is in radiology for CT scan</li>
  <li>Within 45 minutes  results of CT scan are available</li>
  <li>Within 60 minutes tPA  is given if indicated</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neurological signs and symptoms are  quickly identified, and last known well (LKW) is documented. The LKW is the  last time the caregiver can definitely say that the patient was functioning  normally. Once the LKW is verified, the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) tool is  used to appropriately identify a patient as high priority. The ESI is a five-level EC  triage algorithm that  provides clinically relevant stratification of patients into one of five groups,  from 1 (most urgent) to 5 (least urgent), on the basis of acuity and resource  needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Clinical Practice Guidelines are based on  research provided by the American Heart Association and American Stroke  Association. Three practice changes were made as a result of the collaboration  between EC clinical nurses, Solecki and the multidisciplinary Stroke Team: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A Code Stroke may be  initiated by the clinical nurse. </li>
  <li>All possible stroke  patients with an LKW of 12 hours or less would be given an ESI score of 1 and  thereby treated as a high priority patient. </li>
  <li>Treatment for patients  presenting to the EC with stroke-like symptoms was adjusted to ensure faster  recognition of ischemic stroke. <br>
    <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP14-2.pdf">(Evidence EP14-2, Emergency Center and In-House Acute  Stroke Algorithm) </a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Change in Practice</strong><br>
  After significant collaboration with the Stroke  Team, the EC nursing leadership team looked further into nurse-driven steps that  could be incorporated into the EC clinical nurse&rsquo; practice. A resource that was  available but rarely used by the EC RNs was the stroke protocol Advanced  Treatment Guideline (ATG) - Stroke Adult. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ATG includes signs and symptoms of a  possible stroke, parameters for ESI scoring based on LKW, and diagnostic and  treatment modalities including the order in which they should be done. Based on  the triage assessment, the EC clinical nurse would do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assess for signs and  symptoms of stroke</li>
  <li>Establish last know well</li>
  <li>Perform blood glucose</li>
  <li>Order head CT scan</li>
  <li>Obtain EKG, place on  pulse oximetry and place patient on monitor</li>
  <li>Secure IV access</li>
  <li>Obtain other diagnostic  testing</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During its meetings, the Stroke Team discussed  ways in which BGP would change its practice to better serve patients. For  patients presenting with neurological symptoms and a LKW of 12 hours or less, the  nurse would autonomously initiate the Code Stroke before seeing the physician,  and facilitate moving the patient to CT before establishing an IV or doing an  EKG. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP14-3.pdf">(Evidence EP14-3,  Policy 1010 Stroke- Adult; September 1, 2016 Meeting Minutes of Stroke Team)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Beaumont Health Advanced Treatment  Guidelines, in conjunction with EC and Neurology physicians, the EC clinical  nurses are empowered to use the resources available to them to make the  autonomous decision to initiate a Code Stroke to improve outcomes for patients presenting  to the BGP Emergency Center.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Autonomous Decision-making  in Clinical Practice </strong><br>
  On May 21, 2017, patient M.L. arrived at the  BGP Emergency Center at 10:35 a.m. with symptoms of a stroke. The EC clinical  nurse called a Code Stroke based on the information the nurse had received from  Emergency Medical Service (EMS) from the field; the LWK time was 10:10 a.m. The  following is stroke care provided, in chronological order, by the clinical  nurses, physicians and ancillary care providers at BGP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to the patient arriving to the Emergency  Center, the clinical nurses autonomously called the Code Stroke, which summoned  the Stroke Team to the EC. Based on the protocol, the clinical nurse can  independently call a Code Stroke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the patient arrived, Ashely Brooke Meier,  BSN, RN, clinical nurse, Emergency Center, determined that a blood sugar and  vital signs were not required at the time since they had just been completed by  EMS.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between 10:36 and 10:40 a.m., Meier and the  physician completed their assessment.   Based on Meier&rsquo;s assessment, the patient showed the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mumbled noise when  patient tried to talk</li>
  <li>Confusion</li>
  <li>Right sided weakness</li>
  <li>Right sided facial  droop</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meier  autonomously determined that the patient was showing signs and symptoms of a  stroke, so she sent MD to the Radiology Department at 10:42 a.m. for a head CT  scan without contrast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 11:00  a.m., Meier completed the nursing swallow screen per protocol. The swallow  screen includes the following assessment points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are there past or  present signs or symptoms of a stroke, TIA, or neurological impairment?</li>
  <li>Is the patient alert,  cooperative and able to follow simple commands?</li>
  <li>Upon completion of the adult  nursing swallow screen for the administration of oral medications, M.L. failed  the swallow screen so Meier made M.L. nothing by mouth (NPO).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on  the assessments of Meier, the CT tech and physician, tPA was given to M.L.  </p>
<p>EC  clinical nurse Meier followed the stroke care protocol ,and by 11:57 a.m. the  patient reported an improvement in their speech and strength. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP14-4.pdf">(Evidence EP14-4, EC Timeline of  Care and Screen Shots from Electronic Medical Record)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nurses in the Emergency Center use the  evidence-based stroke protocol to support autonomous nursing care decisions for  patients with acute stroke symptoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Two: Using the Transcutaneous Bilimeter  to Promote Autonomous Practice in the Family Birth Center </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evidence-based Resources</strong><br>
  The American Academy of  Pediatrics (AAP) clinical practice guideline on the management of  hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn  recommends, that prior to discharge, all  infants be assessed for the risk of subsequent severe hyperbilirubinemia by measuring  the total serum bilirubin (TsB) or trancutaneous bilirubin (TcB) and plotting  the value on a nomogram. This information is valuable because it gives the  clinical nurse caring for a newborn in the hospital setting a simple and  relevant measure of the risk of subsequent development of hyperbilirubinemia. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In August 2013, as part  of the effort to allow the clinical nurses in the Family Birth Center (FBC) at  Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) to care for newborns autonomously, the  Transcutaneous Bilirubin/Jaundice Meter policy was updated to reflect the most recent  research from Jeffery Maisels, MD, Chief of Pediatrics, Beaumont Health, related  to the monitoring of bilirubin levels in the newborn and the appropriate  follow-up. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP14-5.pdf">(Evidence EP14-5,  Policy 6346 Transcutaneous Bilirubin/Jaundice  Meter) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guidelines n this policy  were developed following the realization that institutions were struggling to  follow the AAP recommendations. The AAP recommendations are to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Screen  all newborns prior to discharge for elevated bilirubin levels</li>
  <li>Follow  up for all newborn based TcB levels, gestational age and other risk factors</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of the guidelines and updated policy was to  reduce the incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia and resulting bilirubin  encephalopathy. Maisels&rsquo; research and recommendations included performing  universal predischarge bilirubin screening using TsB or TcB measurements to  assess the risk of subsequent severe hyperbilirubinemia. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP14-6.pdf">(Evidence EP14-6, Article Hyperbilirubinemia  in the Newborn Infant ) 35 Weeks Gestation: An Update with Clarifications and  –Routine Transcutaneous Bilirubin Measurement Combined with Clinical Risk  Factors Improve the Prediction of Subsequent Hyperbilirubinemia) </a> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recommendations  that were built into the policy included a more structured approach to the  management and follow-up based on the pre-discharge TsB/TcB, gestational age  and other hyperbilirubinemia risk factors.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Resource</strong><br>
  Policy 6346  Transcutaneous Bilirubin/Jaundice Meter was updated by Audrey Kalask, MSN, RN,  PNP-BC, Clinical Nurse Specialist, Beaumont Royal Oak NICU, and Brian Berman,  MD, Health System Chair, Pediatrics. It was then circulated and appproved by  the Administrative Manager, Clinical Nurse Specialist and Pediatric Chiefs of  Beaumont Grosse Pointe, Beaumont-Royal Oak and Beaumont Troy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once  the policy was approved, all clinical nurses caring for newborns on the BGP  Family Birth Center were educated on the use of the Transcutaneous Bilimeter  JM-103.  <br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Change  in Clinical Practice</strong> <br>
  In September 2013, based on Maisels&rsquo; work on  hyperbilirubinemia, bilirubin plotting on a nomogram and the corresponding  follow-up guidelines were automated in oneChart. <br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to assisting the clinical nurse to assess the  infant&rsquo;s risk of developing subsequent hyperbilirubinemia, this feature  includes management and follow-up guidelines, phototherapy guidelines, exchange  transfusion guidelines, and training and references. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP14-7.pdf">(Evidence EP14-7, IT Communication Bilirubin Nomogram) </a><br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This gives the clinical nurse immediate access to relevant  clinical guidelines. The bilirubin nomogram is accessible from the rounding,  admission, shift and discharge navigators of Epic (BGP&rsquo;s electronic medical  record), and is visible for providers in the office visit navigator and telephone  encounter navigator. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clinical nurse  caring for the newborn on the BGP Family Birth Center follows the physician&rsquo;s  order within the IP Newborn Admission Protocol-FBC/LDRP order set and the  Transcutaneous Bilirubin/Jaundice Meter Policy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clinical nurse is  autonomous in caring for the infant. She or he uses this resource and the data  from the TcB reading to care for the infant using evidence-based practice. Once  the TcB reading is entered into Epic, it is automatically plotted on the Bilirubin  Nomogram graph, which takes into account the Hyperbilirubin Risk and  Neurotoxicity Risk factors. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TcB policy and Newborn Admission Protocol order set were  instituted for all clinical nurses to autonomously care for newborns. According  to the physician-to-nurse orders within the IP Newborn Admission  Protocol-FBC/LDRP and the policy, the nurse orders and obtains a serum neonatal  bilirubin level (TsB) if the infant is jaundiced at &lt; 24 hours of age or if  the TcB reading is &gt;95% at any age according to the Bilirubin Nomogram. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP14-8.pdf">(Evidence EP14-8, Order Set-IP  Newborn Admission Protocol-FBC/LDRPand TcB flowsheet and nomogram in EPIC)</a></p>
<a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP14-8.pdf"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Autonomous  Decision-making In Clinical Practice</strong><br>
  On June 13, 2017 at 0300, Christina Richard, BSN, RN, clinical  nurse, Family Birth Center, as part of the routine newborn nursing care, obtained  an initial TCB reading on the infant on the first day of life, at 17 hours of  age. The Tcb was 10.9 and was entered in the EMR on the flowsheet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results auto-populated on the Bilirubin Nomogram graph ,and  Richard noted that the result was above the 95th percentile. Richard  followed the Transcutaneous Bilirubin policy and IP Newborn Admission Protocol,  which allowed her to obtain and send a serum bilirubin sample. The results of  the serum bilirubin were 7.3 mg/dl, which was still above the 95th  percentile on the Bilirubin Nomogram. Richard reported the results to the  attending pediatrician.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 0900, another serum bilirubin was obtained by Judith  Constant, BSN, RN, C-EFM, clinical nurse, Family Birth Center, per protocol, and  the results were 9.5 at 25 hours of age, which was again above the 95th  percentile. Constant notified the physican. Orders were obtained for triple  phototherapy for the baby and a repeat serum bilirubin at 1800.  <br>
  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP14-9.pdf">(Evidence EP14-9, Screen  Shot of Electronic Medical Record) </a><br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nurses at BGP use  evidence-based resources such as the Transcutaneous Bilirubin/Jaundice Policy  to support autonomous decision-making in the care of patients.</p>
