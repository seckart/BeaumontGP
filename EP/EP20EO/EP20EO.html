<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  One: Decreasing the CAUTI Rate on 2 South</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  Multiple recent studies have shown that  the use of indwelling urinary catheters increases the risk of acquiring a  catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). Despite the sterile  insertion of catheters, CAUTIs regularly occur in the acute care setting. A  hospital-acquired CAUTI is financially costly to an organization due to  increased length of stay with a lack of reimbursement and an increased  possibility of untimely readmission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A CAUTI is also costly to the patient  physically, with increased morbidity and possibly mortality due to sepsis. The evidence  demonstrates that the only reliable and sustainable way to reduce the incidence  of CAUTIs is to reduce the use of catheters. Based on the evidence,  organizations across the country have established nurse-driven protocols for  the removal of indwelling urinary catheters in the absence of established  criteria for their continued need. Aggressive implementation of these protocols  was associated with lower catheter use and reduced infection rates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CAUTIs are one of the nurse-sensitive  quality measures reported to NDNQI quarterly. Kim Little, BSN, RN, Assistant  Nurse Manager, and Pam Lively, BSN, RN, Assistant Nurse Manager, reviewed the  NDNQI results for fourth quarter 2015 and noted that the CAUTI rate for 2  South, which had been at 0 for the first, second and third quarters, had increased  to a 7.63 in fourth quarter 2015. The CAUTI rate is measured by the number of  catheter-associated urinary tract infections per 1,000 catheter days</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Little and Lively conducted extensive  reviews of the cases in which a CAUTI had been identified, and they noted that  in each instance the Foley had been placed prior to admission to 2 South.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Little and Lively discussed this with 2  South clinical nurses Beth Thomas, RN; Emily Gross, BSN, RN; and Sharon Mysierowicz,  RN and believed that the patients were frequently coming to 2 South from the  Emergency Center (EC) with the indwelling urinary catheters in place. This was  discussed with the EC clinical nurses, who explained that this was an efficient  method for collecting urine samples upon arrival to the EC.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patients were also being transferred to 2  South from the Critical Care Stepdown Unit (CCSU) and the Critical Care Unit  (CCU) with indwelling urinary catheters, as this  was part of protocol for critically ill patients. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In both of these cases, as part of the Beaumont  Grosse Pointe (BGP) nurse-driven indwelling urinary catheters protocol, the  expectation is that the Foley should be discontinued before the transfer to an  inpatient medical/surgical unit. Little and Lively, with the input of clinical  nurses Thomas, Gross and Mysierowicz, decided that action needed to be taken at  the unit level to eliminate CAUTIs on 2 South. They discussed enlisting the  assistance of the Unit Practice Council to work on a process improvement plan  to decrease the number of indwelling urinary catheters on the unit, thereby  decreasing the number of CAUTIs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CAUTI rate on 2 South in fourth quarter  2015 was 7.63, as measured by the number of catheter-associated urinary tract  infections per 1,000 catheter days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To decrease the CAUTI rate on 2 South.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  <em>January  2016 </em><br>
  Little and Lively met with Gael Rodgers,  BSN, RN, Clinical Infection Preventionist, and Laura Gleason, BSN, RN, Clinical  Infection Preventionist. They reviewed each CAUTI case on 2 South to follow the  sequence of events leading up to it. Documentation revealed that the indwelling urinary catheters had been placed prior to  admission to 2 South and should have been discontinued before the patient&rsquo;s  arrival to the unit. Further, the staff on 2 South did not proactively  discontinue the indwelling urinary catheters upon arrival or within the  calendar day. Gleason and Rodgers therefore agreed that, per policy, the CAUTIs  would be attributed to 2 South even though the unit was not initially responsible  for the deviation from protocol. Little and Lively discussed the probability  that staff members were not aware of the critical nature of timely  intervention.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information was shared and evaluated  with the 2 South Unit Practice Council (UPC) at its next scheduled meeting. The  council members, clinical nurses Thomas; Annette Gipperich, RN; Timothy Pierce,  BSN, RN; and Michael Hoekstra, BSN, RN, discussed the findings and determined that  something must be done to prevent further CAUTIs on 2 South. As the UPC members  were not aware of the importance of removing the Foley in a timely manner, they  decided that education should be provided to the clinical nurses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UPC members decided that to decrease  the number of indwelling urinary catheters on the unit, they had to stop them  before these patients were admitted to the unit. They decided that they would  review the criteria for an indwelling urinary catheter when the clinical nurses  from EC, CCSU and CCU call to transfer the patient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clinical nurses were encouraged, as they  accepted a transfer from the EC, CCSU or CCU, to question and research the need  for the indwelling urinary catheter if the patient had one in place. They were instructed  to ask the transferring nurse to remove the indwelling urinary catheter if not  clinically indicated. The only clinical indications for the indwelling urinary catheter  to remain in place were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bladder dysfunction and  urinary retention</li>
  <li>Accurate fluid intake  and output for CCU</li>
  <li>Short-term use for  surgery</li>
  <li>Management of  incontinence of patients with sacral wounds</li>
  <li>Bladder irrigation</li>
  <li>Epidural catheter in  place for pain control</li>
  <li>Relieve urinary tract  obstruction</li>
  <li>Fracture of spine,  pelvis or lower extremity</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were also encouraged to review the  EC timeline prior to the patient&rsquo;s admission to the unit to determine whether  the order and the criteria were accurate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>January  2016</em><br>
  Little and Lively began sharing their  findings one-on-one with the clinical nurses each day. The information was  shared electronically, included in the UPC minutes and discussed at staff meetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>February  2016</em><br>
  Little and Lively discussed the  importance of timely adherence to the nurse-driven protocol with each of the  off shift charge nurses (clinical nurses Judy Thueme, RN;  Sandra Kanas, RN; Susan Zabel, BSN, RN; MaryEllen  Riker, RN; Tricia Giles, RN; and Rebecca Ryan, RN). The charge nurses were  asked to monitor for indwelling urinary catheters every day at midnight. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The charge nurses were expected to  question the clinical nurses caring for the patient to determine whether  criteria for the continuation of the indwelling urinary catheter were met. If the  criteria were not met, the nurses were to discontinue the catheter. Little and  Lively discussed indwelling urinary catheters placement with each nurse during  daily Care Management Rounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>March  2016</em><br>
  Throughout March, the UPC champions,  charge nurses and Assistant Nurse Managers made concerted and continued efforts  to engage each clinical nurse in 2 South&rsquo;s work to  eliminate CAUTIs. By the end of March, the staff had begun to incorporate the  adherence to the protocol into their daily plans of care, and they began to  feel comfortable discussing indwelling urinary catheters placement with all nurses  at BGP.</p>

<p><strong>Outcomes</strong><br>
  2 South clinical nurse involvement in addressing the  unit&rsquo;s CAUTI rate resulted in an improvement in patient safety. The 2 South  CAUTI rate was 7.63 in fourth quarter 2015. After implementing interventions  during January, February and March 2016, the 2 South CAUTI rate decreased.</p>

<p><strong>Example  Two: Decreasing Falls on the Critical Care Stepdown Unit by Implementing Hourly  Rounding</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  Keeping patients safe is a cornerstone  of nurses&rsquo; practice. Despite best practices, and policies and procedures  designed to prevent patient falls, these events still occur. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late December 2016, Sue Wolka, BSN,  RN, NE-BC, Administrative Manager, Critical Care Stepdown Unit (CCSU), was  reviewing data on the number of falls that had occurred on the unit. Wolka  tracked the data weekly and noted an increase in the number of falls. The CCSU  fall rate for December 2016 was 2.99, measured by the number of falls per 1,000  patient days. Wolka decided to involve the CCSU Unit Practice Council in  developing a plan to address the problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wolka met with Melissa Haezebrouck, BSN,  RN, clinical nurse and chairperson of the CCSU Unit Practice Council (UPC), at  the end of December 2016 to discuss the issue and ask that the UPC develop a  program to decrease the number of falls.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCSU nurses recognized the need to  decrease the number of patient falls. They were also aware that patients&rsquo;  perception of nurses&rsquo; responsiveness to their needs was falling short of what was  expected. </p>
<p>Recognizing an opportunity to improve  patients&rsquo; perception of prompt attention to their needs while decreasing the  number of patient falls, the clinical nurses were empowered to develop a plan  to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCSU fall rate for December 2016 was 2.99, measured by the number of falls per 1,000 patient  days.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal Statement</strong> <br>
  To decrease the fall rate on the Critical Care  Stepdown Unit.<strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description of the  Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  All interventions  were implemented in January and February 2017.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>January 2017 </em><br>
  During the January UPC meeting, the nurses  discussed the data on the number of falls on CCSU for the previous six months:</p>
<ul>
  <li>July 2016 – 3 falls</li>
  <li>August 2016 – 2 falls</li>
  <li>September 2016 – 2  falls</li>
  <li>October 2016 – 3 falls</li>
  <li>November 2016 – 2 falls</li>
  <li>December 2016 – 3 falls</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data demonstrated that the CCSU nurses  needed to take action to reduce patient falls in the CCSU. The UPC discussed  this and decided to investigate the issue and possible solutions and develop a  plan for decreasing falls at the February meeting.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>February 8, 2017</em><br>
  The UPC members identified the opportunity to  reduce patient falls on the unit and explored ways of putting a fall reduction  program into place. Allyce Grover, RN, clinical nurse, CCSU, had previously worked  at Beaumont Grosse Point&rsquo;s (BGP) sister hospital, Beaumont Troy. Grover noted  that her previous unit had successfully used hourly rounding on all patients to  decrease the number of patient falls. Grover said all nursing staff members  were expected to engage in hourly rounding or have a substitute rounder if they  were unable to round at their assigned time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Grover&rsquo;s account of hourly rounding as an  example, the UPC members developed a plan for CCSU:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The  unit would be divided into two sections: Rooms 230-239 would be considered the  front of the unit and rooms 240-250 would be considered the back. </li>
  <li>One  caregiver would be assigned to round on the front half of the unit and a second  caregiver would be assigned to round on the back half. </li>
  <li>Hourly  rounding would consist of going to each patient&rsquo;s bedside and asking them about  the fours &ldquo;P&rsquo;s&rdquo;: Pain, Positioning, Potty, Possessions. The nurses would ask the patients:</li>
  <li>Do  you need anything for pain?</li>
  <li>Are  you comfortable in the your bed or do you need to be repositioned? </li>
  <li>Do  you have to go the bathroom?</li>
  <li>Do  you need anything moved closer to your bedside?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the UPC meeting, the nurses created a  rounding sheet including a script to help staff members ensure all patient  needs were met. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grover suggested adding the question, &ldquo;Is  there anything else I can do for you before I leave?&rdquo; to give patients another  opportunity to voice any other questions or concerns outside of the four &ldquo;P&rsquo;s&rdquo;.  Both day and night shift nurses would be expected to take part in the hourly  rounding program.
  <br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting, the UPC members met with Wolka, who supported this  plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>February  10, 2017</em><br>
  Haezebrouck sent a unit-wide email explaining  to all nursing staff members the concept of hourly rounding, staff  responsibilities and expectations, and guidelines. The email included two  evidence-based practice articles supplied by Grover detailing the benefits of  hourly rounding and clinical nurses&rsquo; role in reducing patient falls. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>February  13, 2017</em><br>
  A CCSU staff meeting was held to further  explain roles and responsibilities and the hourly rounding program, and for  staff members to express any questions or concerns. It was decided that the  hourly rounding program would begin on February 20, 2017. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>February  13-14, 2017</em><br>
  To gather additional data on the impact  of the hourly rounding program, the nurses had a report created to capture the  number of call lights that were put on during the 24 hours prior to the implementation  of the rounding program; this was 190. They plan  to monitor this over time to see whether there is a decrease in call lights  after the implementation of hourly rounding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>February  20-28, 2017</em><br>
  The implementation of all interventions was  complete and the hourly rounding program on CCSU began on March 1, 2017.  </p>
