<h2>Staffing, Scheduling, and Budgeting Processes EP10</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Nurses  use trended data in the budgeting process, with clinical nurse input, to  redistribute existing nursing resources or obtain additional nursing resources.</em></strong></p>
<UL>
  <li><em>Provide<strong> </strong></em><em>two examples with  supporting evidence from different practice settings where trended data was  used during the budget process, with clinical nurse input, to assess  actual-to-budget performance to redistribute existing nursing resources or to  acquire additional nursing resources. Trended data must be presented.</em> </li>
 
</UL>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: Using Trended Data to Add a Charge Nurse (T-Code  and Q-Code) to the Critical Care Unit Staffing Matrix </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  budget process in healthcare is ongoing, with resources being distributed and  redistributed to meet patient care needs. The  personnel resources allocated to the Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) Critical Care  Unit (CCU) were evaluated and additional resources acquired based on the  input of clinical nurses, the data on patient volume and Culture of Safety  (COS) survey scores, and an existing staffing matrix.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Practice Setting</strong><br>
  The staffing plan for CCU included clinical nurses, clinical assistants  and nursing assistants, but it did not provide for a charge nurse without a  patient assignment. The clinical nurse &ldquo;in charge&rdquo; accepted a patient  assignment along with the role of managing patient throughput for the shift and  sharing miscellaneous duties such as helping clinical nurses house-wide with a  variety of tasks, including challenging IV starts on midnights. The clinical  nurse in charge would also respond to Rapid Response calls and code calls. A  Rapid Response call is an emergency in the hospital that requires a CCU  clinical nurse to be in attendance. A code is when a patient is having a  cardiac emergency, and the CCU clinical nurse is part of the team that responds.  CCU clinical nurses are considered a professional resource for clinical nurses  throughout BGP.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCU average daily census in 2015 and the first half of 2016 was 10 patients. The  staffing plan called for 6 RNs, 1 nursing assistant and 1 clinical assistant. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP10-1.pdf">(Evidence EP10-1, Unit Matrix  Staffing Plan, August 24, 2015)</a>  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCU patient acuity varied and was taken into consideration  when staffing decisions were made for the shift. On most shifts, however, the  staffing was determined based on the staffing matrix. If the acuity of the  patients was high, overtime and the Internal Resource Team would be used to  supplement CCU staffing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This  staffing level was the center of frequent discussions  between CCU clinical nurses and Kelly Adams, MSN, RN, CCU Administrative  Manager. Adams frequently met with the midnight shift to discuss issues that  were important to clinical nurses.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Nurse Input</strong><br>
  During  one of the discussions with Shawmain Duplessis, BSN, RN and Pattie Kaminski,  BSN, RN, clinical nurses on the midnight shift, they expressed concerns to  Adams regarding the workload of CCU clinical nurses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issues they discussed  included: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The impact  of vacant positions </li>
  <li>The impact  of the Internal Resource Team nurses&rsquo; CCU experience  </li>
  <li>Less experienced  clinical nurses being pulled to the CCU</li>
  <li>The lack of  a dedicated charge nurse in the CCU</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In preparation for the Nursing Department&rsquo;s Strategic Planning  Session to be held in December 2016, Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Vice  President and Chief Nursing Officer, sent a memo in  October 2016 to solicit input from clinical nurses. In November 2016, Stewart  received a reply from the CCU Unit Practice Council  (UPC) regarding the need for a charge nurse on the midnight shift. This feedback  validated the previous COS survey scores and comments about the need for a CCU  charge nurse on the midnight shift. The UPC  told Stewart:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;On our unit, we do not  have a T code or a Q code (Charge RN) like the majority of the other nursing  units do. This person is required to answer the designated charge phone which  rings regularly, facilitate admissions, discharges, and transfers, and serve as  a resource person for all other nurses, all of which is exceedingly difficult  with the responsibilities of Charge RN and caring for two critically ill  patients.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stewart  shared the UPC&rsquo;s memo with Adams and Reinman. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP10-2.pdf">(Evidence EP10-2, Memo from Unit Practice Council  regarding Staffing)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trended Data</strong><br>
  Duplessis and Kaminski were aware of the turnover, especially of  seasoned nurses, that was occurring in the CCU. The reasons for the turnover included  resignations to move or work closer to home, transferring to other positions in  anticipation of completing an advanced degree and transferring to other  specialized units outside of the CCU, such as Hemodialysis or Surgical  Intensive Care Unit.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the staffing challenges resulting from nurse turnover, the average patient  days was trending upward from fourth quarter 2015 to first quarter 2017. This  data, which is the volume of patients who occupy a CCU bed at midnight averaged  for the month, was consistent with the upward trend in overall volume  throughout the hospital.   Although the  patient days were below budget, the actual average monthly census was  increasing. At BGP, the budget is used as a guideline to plan staffing,  but day to day and shift to shift staffing is based on the actual census.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When requesting increases in budgeted  FTEs, BGP reviews actual average daily census (ADC) compared  to the staffing plan. The number of nurses required for the unit is  determined by the ADC and the staffing matrix, and this is compared to the  budgeted FTEs. The Internal Resource Team (IRT) is used to supplement staffing for  short-term census fluctuations. However, sustained increases in patient volume  are addressed through adjustments to budgeted staffing numbers. </p>

<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP10-3.pdf">(Evidence EP10-3, Patient Days)</a></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of Data </strong><br>
  Adams continued to monitor the census monthly and quarterly and  began to see a slight increase in the number of patients. Although the census  was not meeting the budget census, Adams was seeing an increase in the actual  ADC.  <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the suggestion of Duplessis and Kaminski, Adams determined that  the need for additional staffing was warranted based on the increase in the  average monthly patient days. The average monthly census increased from 258  patients in fourth quarter 2015 to 282 patients in fourth quarter 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Acquisition of Additional Nursing  Resources</strong><br>
  The budget process at  Beaumont GGP is ongoing, with adjustments made throughout the year to meet units&rsquo;  patient care needs. Unit staffing is based on a flex budget, which  means that if the census is above budget on the unit, more staff may need to be  added, and if the census is below budget, reductions in the staff may be  necessary. The reduction in staffing numbers may be accomplished by not filling  open positions or floating staff members to a different unit.  <strong> </strong><br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adams and Marie Reinman, BSN, RN, Director of Critical Care and  Heart and Vascular, held multiple informal meetings to discuss clinical nurses&rsquo; feedback and the need to  institute a CCU charge nurse role, which would be an additional resource for clinical  nurses. The charge nurse would not normally have a patient assignment, but  would serve as a support to the other CCU nurses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adams, Reinman and Stewart held a brief discussion in February  2016 that resulted in Adams obtaining approval for a charge nurse without a  patient assignment on Adams&rsquo; days off.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clinical nurses gave positive feedback about having this  charge nurse available on selected days, but there was still a need for the  positon beyond those times. After a careful review of the staffing in CCU, and  with Reinman&rsquo;s guidance, it was determined that having a charge nurse in the  CCU 24 hours a day, seven days a week would require 4.5 FTEs. 
  <br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  September 2016, Adams and Reinman met with Stewart to  present the request for a CCU charge nurse on  day and night shifts. Along with the average patient days, COS survey scores  with comments and the number of posted positions in the CCU, the clinical  nurses believed their perspective was well supported. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reviewing the data, Stewart approved the posting and filling  of a charge nurse position on the day shift. This charge nurse position was rotated  through the most seasoned clinical nurses, as identified by peers and Adams, who  expressed a willingness to accept the position. In September 2016, a day shift charge  nurse role was instituted in the staffing plan. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP10-4.pdf">(Evidence EP10-4, Email of February 16,  2016 Meeting, and Email of September 12, 2016 Meeting)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The day shift  charge nurse position was approved in September 2016, and the charge nurse  position was added to the staffing matrix for CCU. The additional staffing was  submitted for the 2017 budget. Adams, believing that it was more important to  the operations that the bedside clinical nurses have reasonable workloads to  provide quality care to patients, decided to continue to assist with the day to  day operations of the unit.  <br>
  <br>
  In January 2017, a midnight shift charge  nurse role was added to the staffing plan for CCU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As staffing challenges were resolved,  the matrix, which includes a day and midnight shift charge nurse as well as a  nursing assistant and clinical assistant, has been satisfactory to the CCU  clinical nurses. Once a change is made on the staffing matrix, it becomes part  of the budget. The staffing matrix determines the clinical nurse FTE count for  the budget. On September 7, 2016, the staffing matrix was adjusted to add a  charge nurse on the day shift. On January 1, 2017, the staffing matrix was  changed to add a charge nurse on the midnight shift. The current staffing  matrix for the CCU has a charge nurse on both the day shift and midnight  shift.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCU&rsquo;s most recent (March 2017) COS survey  score for overall perception of safety was 80%, the highest score in the last  five years. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP10-5.pdf">(Evidence EP10-5,  Staffing Matrix for 2016 and 2017, FA Repot Regarding FTEs and COS Report) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation</strong><br>
  The Unit Practice Council discussed the addition of charge nurses during  its January 2017 meeting, where the role and responsibilities of the charge  nurse were formalized.  The  responsibilities of the charge nurse include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Making staff  assignments at the beginning and throughout the shift as needed</li>
  <li>Responding to codes  and RRT calls </li>
  <li>Leading a safety  huddle </li>
  <li>Completing audits as  assigned</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinical nurses&rsquo; ongoing feedback was requested. CCU Clinical nurse.  Necola Table, RN and Mary Kuznia, RN, CCRN provide ongoing feedback about the charge  nurse role and suggestions for improving this acquired resource.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Two: Acquisition of Additional Radiology  Nurse Positions</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Practice  Setting</strong><br>
  At Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP), the  Radiology Department employs clinical nurses in the ultrasound and CT  department of General Radiology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clinical  Nurse Input</strong><br>
  On November 21, 2016, Michelle Moore,  BSN, RN, clinical nurse, General Radiology, approached Heidi Kemper, MSN, RN,  Administrative Manager, Interventional Heart and Vascular and Radiology Nursing,  to discuss concerns regarding staffing challenges in the department. Moore was  a part-time nurse in the department, and due to volumes in the department the  workload was beginning to get overwhelming. <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time, the department was short a  0.5 FTE, which is 20 hours per week. There was one other clinical nurse in the  department, Mary Schultheis, BSN, RN, who worked a 0.5 FTE, or 20 hours per  week, schedule.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moore and Schultheis worked together on some of  the same days, but they most often worked opposite days, leaving only one  clinical nurse in the department. In late November 2016, Schultheis gave her notice  of intent to terminate her employment at BGP in early 2017. She was committed  to the unit and wanted to give Kemper plenty of time to find a replacement for  her. Moore expressed her concern to Kemper about this and its ramification for  the clinical nurse staffing in the Radiology Department. The concerns that  Moore expressed were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increased volume</li>
  <li>Lack of available  clinical nurses</li>
  <li>Lack of flexibility of  her schedule due to her commitment to school</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP10-6.pdf">(Evidence EP10-6, Notes of Meeting  between Moore and Kemper) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trended  Data</strong><br>
  Moore and Kemper had held numerous  discussions over the previous six months (February-November 2016) regarding the  increased volumes in the Radiology Department. Moore had kept a tally of the  volumes in the department, and she presented to Kemper various trended data on  its increased volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data below outlines the trended data  for the CT Scan and Ultrasound sections of the Radiology Department. These are  the sections of the department that are most likely to require a clinical nurse  to assist with the procedure. The actual to budgeted procedures were above  budget in all 11 months of 2016. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other trended data that Kemper  reviewed was clinical nurse procedures, which are procedures that require a  nurse to be present when the procedure is being completed.   BGP does not budget for the number of  procedures that require a clinical nurse to be present, as the budget is based  on the patient presenting and the procedure that is being completed. Kemper&rsquo;s review  of the trended data presented demonstrated that the number of procedures for  which a clinical nurse is required to be present had increased in each of the 11  months of 2016 over those months in 2015.</p>

<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP10-7.pdf">(Evidence  EP10-7, Radiology Volume from FA from 2015 and 2016 by Month and Yearly Volume)</a></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the review of the trended data from  the Financial Analyst, Kemper agreed that there was a definite need for two clinical  nurses in General Radiology on a daily basis. Kemper agreed that adding another  FTE would help solve volume, flow and process issues in the Radiology Department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Acquired  Resources</strong><br>
  The budget process at  BGP is ongoing, with adjustments made throughout the year to meet the patient  care needs of the areas. The area&rsquo;s staffing is based on a flex  budget; if the procedure count is above the budget, staffing is evaluated to determine  whether an increase in FTEs is warranted. Staffing is adjusted on a day to day  basis; however, budget positions are completed annually during the budget  process. If there is a need to adjust the budget, compelling data, such as the  data above, must be presented to the Vacancy Review Council.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On November 22, 2016, Kemper met with  Mark LeBlanc, RT(R) (CT) (MR), Manager, Diagnostic Imaging, and Robert  Kilpatrick, BSRS, TRT, Administrative Director, to discuss the staffing  challenges in Radiology and review the trended volume. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a lengthy discussion, they agreed  that the data and numbers provided supported the request to fill a new  position. Kilpatrick requested that Kemper and LeBlanc work together to complete  the paperwork for the request to fill a new position.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The request to fill a new position was  completed by Kemper and LeBlanc and presented to Kilpatrick for approval. The  request was for an additional 0.5 FTE clinical nurse that would complement the  existing 1.0 FTE clinical nurse. The staffing complement would be 1 full-time  FTE clinical nurse and 1 part-time clinical nurse, to bring the total to 1.5  FTE clinical nurses.</p>

Elbadawi, the internal candidate was  offered a 0.8 FTE, and Moore was offered a 0.9 FTE. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP10-10.pdf">(Evidence EP10-10, Job Posting and Email Approving Additional  0.2 FTE) </a></p>
