    <EM><strong>AND</strong></EM>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><em>Provide one  example, with supporting evidence, of organizational autonomy that demonstrates  the authority and freedom of nurses' involvement in broader unit, service line,  organization, or system decision-making processes pertaining to patient care,  policies and procedures, or work environment.</em></li>
  
</UL>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: Use of Extended Dwell Catheters  versus Central Line Catheters</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patients with central lines are at an  increased risk for central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI),  which are dangerous for the patient and costly to the healthcare organization.  According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the average cost of a CLABSI is $45,254 and the  additional average length of stay for a CLABSI patient is 13 days. The risk for  bloodstream infection rises each time a central line is accessed for the administration  of fluids, medications and laboratory blood draws. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CLABSI is a patient quality core measure  that is reported to NDNQI and insurance companies and used as a basis for  reimbursement. The goal for all hospitals is zero CLABSIs, and this is considered  best practice. Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) had a CLABSI rate of 1.96 incidents  per 1,000 central line days in first quarter 2015, with a decrease to 1.50 in  second quarter 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March 2015, to positively impact this  measure and improve the quality of patient care, BGP had to change the practice  of inserting central lines when not necessary. Janet Hamlin, MA, BSN, RN,  Administrative Manager, Internal Resource Team and Nursing Business Office,  reviewed the literature and noted that the use of extended dwell peripheral  intravenous catheters decreased CLABSI rates and were being used as an  alternative to central lines. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hamlin reviewed an article, &ldquo;Accepted  but Unacceptable: Peripheral IV Catheter Failure&rdquo; in the journal <em>The Art and Science of Nursing, </em>and  spoke with Julie Giordano, BSN, RN, Manager, Vascular Access Team, Beaumont  Farmington Hills, about the use of extended dwell (midline) catheters<em>.</em> Hamlin also discussed the use of  extended dwell catheters with Nicholas Gilpin, DO, Medical Director, Infection  Control and Epidemiology, Beaumont Grosse Pointe. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP16-1.pdf">(Evidence EP16-1, Email, Article and Policy of  Beaumont Farmington Hills)</a></p>
<a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP16-1.pdf">
</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May 2015, Hamlin and the IV Team  created a policy on the use of extended dwell catheters for Beaumont Grosse  Point. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP16-2.pdf">(Evidence EP16-2,  Extended Dwell Peripheral Intravenous Catheter)</a> Prior to this, BGP did  not have an alternative to central lines. This policy defined the proper  insertion guidelines, care and maintenance of midlines and the removal of  midlines. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scope of the policy is for nurses  responsible for the insertion, care and maintenance of the midlines in the  inpatient and Emergency Center settings. The practice of inserting extended  dwell catheters is an alternative to central line placement that is available  in clinical nurses&rsquo; practice. These are to be inserted by qualified personnel who  have received appropriate training, including the IV Team and midlevel  providers. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP16-3.pdf">(Evidence EP16-3,  Request to Develop Report for Midline Catheter and Add to LDA Report)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May 2015, a Bard representative provided  education to the IV Team clinical nurses so they would be proficient in  inserting midlines. This education for the IV Team nurses was in accord with Standard  #6 Competence and Competency Validation, of the Infusion Nurses Society Guidelines,  which state:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As a method of public  protection, the nurse shall be competent in the safe delivery of infusion  therapy within her or his scope of practice</li>
  <li>The nurse shall be  responsible and accountable for attaining and maintaining competence with  infusion therapy within her or his scope of practice</li>
  <li>Competency Validation  shall be performed initially and on an ongoing basis</li>
  <li>Competency Validation  shall be documented in accordance with organizational policies, procedures and  practice guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The education was provided to the IV Team  consisting of clinical nurses Casmira Gualtieri, RN; Linda Plunkett, RN, VA-BC;  Cindy Morris, BSN, RN; and Carolyn Ward, BSN, RN. The practice of inserting  midlines then became available in the clinical nurses&rsquo; practice when  considering an alternative to central line placement. 
  <br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June 2015, the IV Team clinical nurses began  inserting extended dwell catheters. After receiving the education, they had the  clinical autonomy to assess the need for and to insert midlines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Autonomy  in Decision Making</strong><br>
  When an inpatient nurse pages the IV Team to  assess the patient&rsquo;s need for an extended dwell catheter rather than a central  line, the IV clinical nurse makes an independent decision about which to use. The  decision to use the extended dwell catheter or central line  is based on the IV Team nurse&rsquo;s assessment of  the patient. The nurse assesses the: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Adequacy of the  patient&rsquo;s vasculature </li>
  <li>Medications the patient  is receiving </li>
  <li>Diagnostic testing that  has been ordered </li>
  <li>Patient&rsquo;s intended  length of stay</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP16-4.pdf">(Evidence EP16-4, Job Description for IV  Nurse)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  midline is typically for short-term use, less than 29 days of medication. Blood  can be drawn from midlines, and they are acceptable for use with power  injectors. Power injectors are used during diagnostic exams, such as a CT scan  in Radiology, when dye is injected into the patient. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IV  nurse has the autonomy to determine, based on her or his assessment, whether  the patient is a candidate for the midline. If not, the practice is for the IV  nurse to make a referral to have a peripherally inserted central catheter  (PICC) placed in Interventional Radiology. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nursing Care Decision  Regarding IV Placement</strong><br>
  On March 24, 2017, A.R., a 91-year-old female,  was admitted to the Critical Care Stepdown Unit with a diagnosis of mental  status changes and UTI. Within the first couple of days, she had two peripheral  IVs that infiltrated and had multiple venipunctures for lab draws. On March 27,  2017, the clinical nurse caring for A.R. paged IV nurse Gualtieri to assess the  patient for a midline. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gualtieri reviewed the patient&rsquo;s chart, noting  the medication orders and the order for a CT. It appeared that the patient  would be admitted for another couple of days because she was on antibiotic  therapy. After analyzing this information, Gualtieri performed a thorough  physical examination of A.R.&rsquo;s extremities, noting her frail, thin skin that  tore easily. As her mental status led her to get agitated easily, she was not  an ideal patient to undergo multiple lab draw attempts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gualtieri made an informed nursing care  decision to insert a midline rather than trying another peripheral that may go  sub-Q during the CT. Another advantage of the midline was that clinical nurses would  be able to draw labs from it, relieving A.R. of the trauma of multiple venipunctures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 30, 2017, based on the clinical  information that the patient was going to be discharged and receiving IV  antibiotics at home, IV nurse Morris made an independent decision to call  Interventional Radiology and have a PICC placed prior to discharge. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP16-5.pdf">(Evidence EP16-5, Screen Shot from  Electronic Medical Record; Inserting Midline, Documentation of Midline and  Referral to IR for PICC Placement) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 31, IV nurse Morris was paged  to assess A.R.&rsquo;s midline site prior to discharge. While trying to discontinue  the midline prior to discharge, the clinical nurse caring for A.R. met some  resistance. The clinical nurse paged Morris, who was able to assist the patient  without causing her discomfort. Morris instructed the patient and family to  call the doctor if they noted bleeding or drainage at the site or if she had  pain or tenderness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinical nurses on the units appreciate  being able to contact an IV clinical nurse for an assessment of whether a  midline can be placed. This is less time consuming for the clinical nurse than  prepping and transporting a patient off the unit for a central line, and it  allows for more attentive care, less risk of CLABSIs and better quality and  safety outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  Two:</strong><strong>Organizational  Autonomy – Nurses Lead and Participate in the Local and Organizational Structures  and Processes that Support the Identification and Treatment of Septic Patients</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with  a high mortality rate, and early identification and treatment is crucial to improving  patient outcomes. Building processes for screening and identifying these  patients requires interprofessional planning and teamwork.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key roles that nurses play in  treating septic patients include early recognition and early goal-directed  therapy. The septic patient&rsquo;s outcome is improved with early recognition of the  signs and symptoms of sepsis and the timely initiation of antibiotics and fluid  resuscitation. Nurses are instrumental in the successful coordination of care  that is imperative for positive outcomes. Nurses are responsible for care  delivery at every phase and are integral to the planning, development and  implementation of the process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two interprofessional committees, the  Corporate Sepsis Workgroup and the Beaumont Grosse Pointe Sepsis Team, have  been influential in developing sepsis care processes and for continuing assessment  of the care provided to sepsis patients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Sepsis Workgroup </strong></a><br>
  The Corporate Sepsis  Workgroup, chaired by William Anderson, MD, includes representatives from Medical/Surgical  nursing, Critical Care nursing, Emergency Department, Information Technology  and physicians from five of the eight Beaumont Health hospitals. Its purpose is to  address many of the system issues surrounding sepsis care and to ensure that clinical  practice is consistent with the best practice requirements for meeting the  sepsis Core Measures. The key to improving sepsis mortality is faster  detection. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key strategies of this workgroup were to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Develop a means to  identify the potentially septic patient and alert the clinical nurse</li>
  <li>Provide autonomy for  the clinical nurse to activate the Rapid Response Team (RRT) based on clinical  judgements</li>
  <li>Collaborate with the  RRT and house physician to ensure the patient receives early goal-directed  therapy </li>
  <li>Improve compliance with  sepsis Core Measures</li>
  <li>Review and analyze data  on sepsis cases to focus on early recognition and treatment of sepsis</li>
</ul>

<p align="center">EP16, Corporate Sepsis Workgroup </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One key area of clinical practice that was  developed by the interprofessional Corporate Sepsis Workgroup was the Sepsis  Surveillance Alert. This automatic alert is generated in the electronic medical  record (EMR) to notify the clinical nurse that a patient is exhibiting signs  and symptoms of sepsis. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February 2015, the Corporate Sepsis  Workgroup defined the criteria associated with sepsis, and the Information  Technology (IT) department created an algorithm in the EMR that checks all  patients for these criteria. When a patient meets the criteria for possible  sepsis, an alert fires to notify the clinical nurse. The clinical nurse then  clinically and critically assesses the patient and autonomously decides whether  the RRT or house physician needs to be called. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/Ep16-6.pdf">(Evidence EP16-6, Sepsis Committee Workgroup Minutes,  February 19, 2015)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March 2015, a pilot of the best  practice alert (BPA) began on two of BGP&rsquo;s busiest medical/surgical units, 2  Southeast and 3 West, and its progressive care unit, the Critical Care Stepdown  Unit. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP16-7.pdf">(Evidence EP16-7, IT  Communication Sepsis Surveillance Alert Pilot Unit Expansion)</a> The trial  was designed to test the criteria selected to identify septic patients. During  the pilot, the Corporate Sepsis Workgroup reviewed all cases in which the BPA  fired to determine its sensitivity. The group discovered that the BPA was too  sensitive and was firing for many patients who were not septic. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Corporate Sepsis Workgroup discussed the  sepsis alert pilot at its March 30, 2016 meeting. Based on the pilot and  feedback from the clinical nurses, the workgroup reviewed and revised the  criteria, narrowed them down to eight, and lengthened the time of the alarm  trigger from every four hours to every 12 hours. Kathy Grady, BSN, RN, Nursing  Informatics, worked with IT personnel to revise the algorithm so the alert  would fire if the patient meets four of the eight criteria. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP16-8.pdf">(Evidence EP16-8, Sepsis Workgroup  Meeting Minutes, March 30, 2016)</a> The  criteria for the sepsis alert are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Male </li>
  <li>Age &gt;50 yrs. </li>
  <li>Shock Index &gt;0.7            </li>
  <li>WBC risk &gt;12 or  &lt;4        </li>
  <li>SYSTOLIC SBP &lt;90       </li>
  <li>HR &gt;95 </li>
  <li>MAP &lt;60 </li>
  <li>Temp Risk &lt;36 or ≥38 </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also at the March 30, 2016 meeting, the team  discussed feedback from the clinical nurses on the pilot units regarding the  documentation flowsheet. Based on this feedback, the team added information into  the EMR to guide the clinical nurses&rsquo; critical thinking and assessment of the  patient for whom the alert was triggered. The Corporate Sepsis Workgroup  responded to the clinical nurses&rsquo; request by creating a hyperlink within the  alert that provides questions to consider when determining whether the patient  has a new or worsening infection. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP16-9.pdf">(Evidence EP16-9, IT Communication Adult Sepsis Screening Alert and  Hyperlink for New or Worsening Infection)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all the trials and revisions were  completed and approved, the alert was implemented system-wide across Beaumont  Health in all appropriate inpatient nursing units in March 2017. It took a year  to complete because this was a corporate initiative and many trials were  performed before this final product was released. It also took time to get all  parties involved in the process to sign off on the final product.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Corporate Sepsis Workgroup continues  to review the data and the effectiveness of the alert. The group&rsquo;s next project  is to create a sepsis alert specific to the identification of a septic patient  in the Emergency Center.</p>
