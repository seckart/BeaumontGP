<h2>Staffing, Scheduling, and Budgeting Processes EP9</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Nurses  are involved in staffing and scheduling based on established guidelines, such  as ANA&rsquo;s </em></strong><strong>Principles for Nurse Staffing<em>, </em></strong><strong><em>to ensure that RN assignments meet the needs of the  patient population.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Provide two examples,  with supporting evidence, from different practice settings when input from  clinical nurses was used to modify RN staffing assignments and/or adjust the  schedule to compensate for a change in patient acuity, patient population,  resources, or redesign of care.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  One: Modifying RN Staffing in the Critical Care Stepdown Unit Based on Patient  Acuity</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nurses are involved in staffing  and scheduling based on established guidelines, such as the American Nurses  Association (ANA) Principles for Nurse Staffing, to ensure that RN assignments  meet the needs of the patient populations. Proper clinical nurse staffing assists  in optimizing patient outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Patient  Population and Acuity</strong><br>
  The Critical Care Stepdown Unit  (CCSU) at Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) is a 39-bed cardiac telemetry unit with  the capability of admitting up to six ventilator-dependent patients. The unit can  admit three ventilator patients without blocking additional beds.  If additional ventilator beds beyond the three  are necessary, a bed in a semi-private room would have to be blocked to  accommodate the ventilator patient.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to  Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients transferring  to CCSU, the CCSU has a patient population with complex,  multi-faceted health issues including patients  with cardiac issues, medical patients with many comorbidities, stable patients  with tracheostomies and ventilated patients. Common diagnoses that are admitted  to CCSU include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Post-cardiac arrest</li>
  <li>Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</li>
  <li>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation</li>
</ul>
<p> <br>
  </p>
<p>Clinical nurses  caring for this patient population must be alert to changes in patient  condition and remain diligent to properly manage the increasing acuity and  complexity of care that is required. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCSU Unit  Practice Council discussed staffing in March 2013 in response to increased  census, including multiple ventilated patients. Before staffing could be  addressed, however, the census decreased and the problem resolved itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Staffing to deliver  safe, quality care to complex ventilated patients and other critical stepdown  patients became a concern again in late 2013. During this time of extremely  high census, an increased number of ventilated patients presented in the BGP Emergency  Center. There was also an increasing number of Critical Care Unit (CCU)  overflow patients present on the CCSU. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCSU staffing was  typically one clinical nurse for every four to five patients. On the day shift,  clinical nurses were  assigned four patients, and on the night shift up to  five patients. One of the patients in the clinical nurses&rsquo; assignment would  frequently be either a ventilated patient or a CCU overflow patient. Because of  the complexity of these patients, clinical nurses became overwhelmed with the  patient care assignment.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Nurse Input into Staffing</strong><br>
  In January 2014, CCSU clinical nurses Lauri Rowland, RN; Michelle Urben, RN; and Shelia Thacker,  BSN, RN described to CCSU Assistant Nurse Managers Sue Wolka, BSN, RN and Eric Quenneville,  BSN, RN the need for an increase in clinical nurse staffing to provide quality  care to ventilated patients and CCU overflow patients. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP9-1.pdf">(Evidence EP9-1, Notes from  January 6, 2014 Conversation) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Urben described the  typical care of a ventilated patient, which included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increased airway management </li>
  <li>Increased turning with attention to skin integrity due to decreased  mobility</li>
  <li>Altered ability to effectively communicate, requiring increased  time at the bedside.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rowland, Urben and  Thacker agreed that the current staffing plan was not adequate to take care of  the stepdown patients when one was a ventilated or a CCU overflow patient. The  matrix dated 10/31/2012 to 5/1/14 did not address additional staff for patients  who are admitted with a ventilator. It was a straight ratio matrix. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP9-2.pdf">(Evidence  EP9-2, 2014 Current Unit Matrix for CCSU dated 10/13/12 through 5/1/2014)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Urben met with a  colleague from the Critical Care Unit to obtain information on the staffing  patterns for critical care patients and ventilated patients in the CCU. The  established patient-to-nurse ratio in CCU was two patients (maximum, ventilated  patients) for one nurse  (2:1 ratio). The CCU matrix was designed with the assumption that most CCU patients  are on a ventilator, requiring a 2:1 patient-to-nurse ratio. The CCSU clinical  nurses wanted a similar staffing matrix for ventilated patients on the CCSU. It was determined that it would be in the best interest of  safe, effective care for complex acuity ventilator patients to establish more  appropriate patient-to-nurse ratios in CCSU for ventilated patients. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP9-3.pdf">(Evidence EP9-3, CCU Staffing  Matrix dated 8/15/2013)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Input into Resources Required</strong><br>
  Rowland, Urben and  Thacker proposed to Wolka and Quenneville that staffing should be increased  based on the number of patients who require a ventilator. Clinical nurses  suggested that the CCSU should have one additional clinical nurse if the unit  has one to two ventilated patients, two additional clinical nurses if the unit has three to four ventilated  patients and three additional clinical nurses if the unit has five to six  ventilated patients. They also said the unit should  have a permanent charge nurse without a patient assignment since the  Assistant Nurse Managers are frequently unavailable for staffing because of  their administrative responsibilities.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wolka and Quenneville  agreed with Rowland, Urben and Thacker&rsquo;s assessment, and they developed a plan  to present the information obtained from the clinical nurses to Marie Reinman,  RN, Director Critical Care and Heart and Vascular. Wolka discussed with Reinman  the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increased number of ventilated patients</li>
  <li>The increased number of CCU overflow patients</li>
  <li>The increased acuity of other CCSU patients</li>
  <li>Benchmarking data obtained from clinical nurses</li>
  <li>What they would like to accomplish</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In early February  2014, Wolka and Quenneville met with Reinman to discuss the clinical nurses&rsquo;  concerns and to solicit Reinman&rsquo;s input into how to operationalize this  request.  They discussed how this was an  un-budgeted staffing request that would have to be reviewed and approved by  Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reinman offered the  following concerns regarding the proposal:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How would CCSU staff this position?</li>
  <li>How frequently would additional staff be required?</li>
  <li>What would happen if the staff is hired and the volume decreases?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reinman suggested  that Wolka take these questions back to clinical nurses and develop talking  points for when they met with Stewart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Staffing  Modification for Higher Acuity</strong><br>
  In late February 2014, Wolka  and Reinman met with Stewart to review the proposed changes to the CCSU staffing  matrix, including how CCSU was going to staff the additional nurses and  what would happen if the volume decreased. They determined that the unit would  staff for at least one ventilator patient per day.  Stewart approved the proposed change that had been developed with clinical  nurses&rsquo; input.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They also discussed  the clinical nurses&rsquo; proposal to have a charge nurse without a patient assignment, which was not approved at the time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 25, 2014,  the CCSU staffing matrix was  modified with the addendum about the increased  staffing when ventilated patients are on the unit. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP9-4.pdf">(Evidence EP9-4, Staffing Matrix  dated 3/24/14)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The enhanced  staffing matrix stayed in place in CCSU through 2016,  and further modifications were made based on continued clinical nurse  input. During the 2015-2016 budget season for fiscal  year 2016, a charge nurse was added to the staffing matrix on the day shift  without a patient assignment. This request of  the clinical nurses from 2014 was now approved in 2016.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One example of the use  of the CCSU staffing matrix comes  from October 26, 2016. CCSU had 33 patients, with one  ventilated patient on the unit in room 248. The following provision of the unit  matrix was used to determine staffing:
    </p><blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;When staffing up for vent volume, be sure to adjust total matrix.  For example, if total census is 28, but there are 5 vents, the 23 non-vented  patients would require 6 clinical nurses with an additional 3 for the vented patients  – not 3 additional to the matrix of 7 for 28 patients.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On October 26, 2016,  the unit had 27 non-vented patients and one vented patient. Based on the unit  matrix, the unit should have eight clinical nurses plus one additional nurse for the vented  patient. There was also a charge nurse without a patient assignment. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP9-5.pdf">(Evidence  EP9-5, Assignment Sheet and Staffing Matrix for October 26, 2016) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ventilated patients continue to  be admitted to the CCSU when the Critical Care Unit is full or the patient does  not meet critical care criteria. CCSU is the only other unit at BGP that is  able to accept ventilated patients. However, clinical nurses are provided  additional resources when the acuity on the unit increases due to ventilated  patients.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Based on clinical nurses&rsquo; input  into staffing adjustments in 2014, the unit acquired additional clinical nurse  resources and an unassigned charge nurse during the day shift based on the  acuity of the patients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Two: Adjusting Scheduling for Emergency  Center Clinical Nurses in Response to Increases in Patient Population Volume  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beaumont Health&rsquo;s mission is to provide  Compassionate, Extraordinary Care Every Day. The focus is on the patients and  families cared for. Beaumont Health also places great importance on caring for  and supporting clinical nurses to meet this mission. Beaumont Health has an  open-door leadership policy, which enables clinical nurses to provide input into  safety, staffing and leadership.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Nurse Input </strong><br>
  <em>Staff Meetings</em><br>
  In August  2014, Emergency Center (EC) clinical nurses discussed staffing problems with EC  nurse leaders. With the volume increase, clinical nurses were informing nurse leaders  that additional RN staffing was needed and a change in scheduling of RN staff  should be considered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on  the concerns that the clinical nurses were expressing regarding the staffing  challenges due to increased volume, the nurse leaders agreed to give a  presentation during the August staff meeting on the status of the staffing in  the EC. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP9-6.pdf">(Evidence EP9-6,  Staff Meeting Minutes, August 26 and 27, 2014 and Attendance Roster)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2014,  the average daily census (ADC) was increasing. The ADC in the Emergency Center  is defined as the average number of patients seen  in a calendar day. The ADC was 95.3 patients in January 2014 and increased to  111.6 in July 2014. This was a 17.1% increase in the number of patients seen in  the EC daily.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EC clinical nurses also believed that adjusting  shift times would assist with the increased patient flow. They agreed that the  EC should have three additional shifts to help cover the peak demand in the  census. The shifts they decided upon were 9 a.m.- 9 p.m., 1 p.m.-1 a.m. and 3  p.m. to 3 a.m.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Satisfaction Surveys – Culture of Safety and  NDNQI Nurse Satisfaction</em><br>
  One way  in which BGP creates a free environment in which to discuss staffing-related  issues is through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Culture  of Safety (COS) Survey. This survey, conducted annually, gives clinical nurses  an opportunity to provide input into staffing. The survey measures the clinical  staff&rsquo;s perception of various topics to gauge how they feel about the safety of  the unit. One of the items on the COS survey completed in December 2014 was,  &ldquo;We have enough staff to handle the workload.&rdquo; In December 2014, 31% of EC  staff members indicated that the EC had enough staff to handle the workload, a  decrease from the December 2013 score of 46%. The 2014 score was below the AHRQ  average of 44%. <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EC clinical nurses also completed the NDNQI RN Satisfaction  Survey in 2014. One of the sections in the survey was Staffing and Resource  Adequacy. BGP uses the following benchmarks when reviewing the results:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compared by: Teaching  Status</li>
  <li>Peer Group: Teaching  Facilities</li>
  <li>Unit Type: Emergency  Centers 30,000-49,999 Annual Visits</li>
  <li>Number of Units: 24</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EC&rsquo;s  score for Staffing and Resource Adequacy was 2.08, compared to the mean score  of the benchmarking group of 2.32 and the median of 2.21. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on  the COS and NDNQI scores, it was evident that something needed to be done to  address the staffing concerns of EC clinical nurses. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP9-7.pdf">(Evidence EP9-7, Emergency Center COS Survey Results,  page 15, and 2014 NDNQI RN Survey Staffing and Resource Adequacy)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clinical nurses&rsquo; input was reviewed by the  Emergency Center leadership team, which included Wendy Jolley, BSN, RN,  Director, and Charlotta Marion, RN, Assistant Nurse Manager. Jolley decided  that something had to be done in response to the concerns about staffing that EC  leadership was hearing and how unsafe nurses felt with the nurse-to-patient  ratio. Based on Jolley&rsquo;s review of the COS and NDNQI data and the conversations  she was having with clinical nurses during her rounding, she realized the  issues needed to be addressed quickly. The nurse leaders discussed various ideas  and process improvements, and they were aware that staff engagement and  participation would be necessary for a successful outcome. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marion identified trends in the comments  about RN staffing, including more clinical nurses being needed to safely care  for patients. Marion spoke with clinical nurses Beverly Gandolfi, RN; Celeste  Decker, BSN, RN; and Brendon Franklin, RN about the staffing issues in the EC. These  clinical nurses said that with the increased volume of patients entering the EC,  they believed there was a need to increase the number of clinical nurses to  ensure they could continue to follow the mission and standards of Beaumont  Health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gandolfi was a senior clinical nurse and had experienced  many staffing changes in the department. She believed that even with the  positive changes over the years, the increase in census and the perceived  increase in the acuity of patients meant that additional staffing was needed to  provide the high-quality healthcare that Beaumont prides itself on. Based on  her experience, Gandolfi knew that patients were presenting in the EC with a  higher acuity, but this could not be confirmed since BGP&rsquo;s EC does not have an  acuity system. In addition, the volume in the EC has steadily increased over the  years:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2013: 28,517 EC Visits</li>
  <li>2014: 30,729 EC Visits</li>
  <li>2015: 30,813 EC Visits</li>
  <li>2016: 42,442 EC Visits<br>
    <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP9-8.pdf">(Evidence EP9-8, Volumes Growth 2010 to  2016 Budgeted)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scheduling Adjustment</strong><br>
  In November 2014,after speaking with Gandolfi, Decker and Franklin, Marion  scheduled an appointment with Christine Stesney-Ridenour, MBA, Vice President  and Chief Operating Officer, regarding clinical nurse staffing in the Emergency  Center. Marion explained to Stesney-Ridenour the barriers to hiring clinical  nurses for the EC. Stesney-Ridenour told Marion to do what she needed to hire  additional ED nurses and that she would speak with Human Resources to provide  the support needed to do so.  Based on  the volumes in the EC, paid FTEs increased from 33.37 FTEs in 2013 to 42.45 FTEs  in 2016. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP9-9.pdf">(Evidence EP9-9,  Clinical Nurse FTEs Over Time)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EC nursing leadership team continued to see  an increase in the ADC in 2014 and 2015. In December 2014,based on previous discussion with clinical nurses, Jolley held additional  informal discussions with clinical nurses about the alternative schedule, and  most agreed that it would be something they could try. The goal was to match  the staffing with the census. Jolley spoke with Gandolfi since she was one of  the senior clinical nurses and had provided information previously, and  Gandolfi thought it was a great idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The leadership team, with input from clinical  nurses, decided that the EC would adjust scheduling by implementing different  shifts, allowing for more nursing staff during the typically busiest hours of  the day. The new schedules began in 2015.The new shifts were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>0900-1900</li>
  <li>1300-0100</li>
  <li>1500-0300</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The staff  matrix outlines the number of nurses that are needed each day of the week at  the various times of the day. The matrix also contains three sections, A, B and  C, to ensure that there are adequate nurses available to cover the shifts seven  days a week. The position control sheet identifies the clinical nurses who are  in the various shifts to cover the staffing requirements for the EC.  The position control sheet identifies the new  shifts that were implemented based on the input from the clinical nurses. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/EP9-10.pdf">(Evidence EP9-10, Position Control)</a>   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The staffing  by hour in the Emergency Center is outlined below:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinical nurses and the leadership team noted that,  with these changes and with nurses hired into these shifts, more nurses were available  to care for patients during peak volume times. Midnight nurses reported more coverage  to assist during the busy times of the night, and decreasing staff at 3 a.m.  was in line with the time of the morning that census began to decrease. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinical nurses began to accept the new shifts  and appreciate the fact that leadership was responding to their input. This was  reflected by an increase in the Culture of Safety score related to staffing. The  COS score for the item, &ldquo;We have enough staff to handle the workload&rdquo; increased  from 31% in December 2014 to 38% in December 2015 and an all-time high of 60%  in December 2016. The NDNQI RN Satisfaction Survey score for Staffing and  Resource Adequacy also increased, from 2.08 in 2014 to 2.47 in 2015.<br>
  <br>
  Beaumont&rsquo;s mission statement is Compassionate,  Extraordinary Care Every Day. This is a mission the EC strives to uphold every  day, every shift and by every team member. EC leadership values clinical  nurses&rsquo; input to uphold this mission. </p>
