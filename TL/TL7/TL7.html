<p align="center">TL7, Surgical Volume Increase,  2013-2016</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many factors contributed to the increased  volume at BGP, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Physician preference  due to efficiency of clinical nurses</li>
  <li>Recruitment of new  physicians</li>
  <li>Flexibility of boarding  procedures </li>
  <li>Patient request and  satisfaction </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  flexibility of boarding has been a great enticement for physicians to bring  their patients to BGP. (Boarding time is when the patient is scheduled for a  surgical procedure.) Staffing is based on the physician schedules to ensure  that the boarding time is acceptable to the patient, physician and hospital. As  surgical volumes increase, so does the requirement of resources for both  staffing and equipment. Equipment needs are identified in several ways. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Equipment requirements  are indicated on the physician boarding request form. </li>
  <li>The clinical nurse who  functions as the Service Line Coordinator reviews the boarding request and  preliminarily determines what equipment is required for the surgical procedure. </li>
  <li>Surgical Services nurse  leaders review equipment needs with clinical nurses who will be directly  working in the case in the Surgical Suite.  </li>
  <li>The equipment needs are  discussed during the 1 p.m. Equipment Huddles every day. The huddles are  attended by the clinical nurse Service Line Coordinators, Material Management  and Central Processing Department. The purpose of the huddle is to identify the  equipment needs for upcoming Operating Room (OR) procedures to ensure the  appropriate equipment is available for the surgery. If there is an issue, the  clinical nurse Service Line Coordinators inform the nurse leader.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Linda Witt, MA, BSN, RN, ONC, Director Surgical  Services, supports and encourages communication between nursing leaders,  clinical nurses and all members of the surgical team. Interdisciplinary Huddle  is held every day at 10 a.m. and is attended by Witt; Kathleen Vandelinder,  BSN, RN, CNOR, Associate Nurse Manager, Surgical Services; clinical nurses; a  physician; a CRNA; a Central Processing clerk; and a midlevel provider. The  purpose of the huddle is to review the current day&rsquo;s schedule, surgical cases  that are three days out and any outstanding issues with future procedures that  could delay or cancel the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Equipment Huddle is conducted at 1 p.m. every  day and is attended by clinical nurses, a Materials Management clerk and  Central Processing clerks, and Vandelinder. The purpose of the huddle is to  ensure all equipment is available for future procedures. The clinical nurse is  ultimately responsible for ensuring that everything that is needed for a  scheduled surgical procedure has been secured.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinical nurses also work closely with Central  Processing Department (CPD) staff and Materials Management staff to ensure  equipment needs are met. Equipment coordination can be very complex because of  constant changes in the procedural environment. The Surgical Suite is  responsive to constant changes in scheduling and physician requests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Nurse Input</strong><br>
  Stephanie Zimmer, BSN, RN, clinical nurse,  Surgical Services, also serves as the Service Line Coordinator for General,  Gynecological, and Robotics. The Service Line Coordinator&rsquo;s function is to review  all upcoming procedures, coordinate equipment needs for current and future  cases, and review and update the Doctors Preference Cards (DPC).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zimmer met with Witt on November 3, 2016 and explained  the issues that were evolving. They discussed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>That the Loner Tray  would no longer be available</li>
  <li>More GYN physicians  requesting instruments</li>
  <li>What to do to avoid  scheduling conflicts</li>
  <li>Obtaining quotes for instruments</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL7-1.pdf">(Evidence TL7-1, Notes from November 3,  2016 Zimmer Conservation and Quote)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trended Data</strong><br>
  The availability of equipment and  instrumentation in OR is critical, and it is also imperative that immediate use  steam sterilization (IUSS), or &ldquo;flashing,&rdquo; is kept to a minimum since it is not  intended for routine use. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flashing is used to quickly sterilize surgical  instruments when they are needed as soon as possible, such as when a patient is  on the OR table and a one of a kind piece of equipment is dropped. Flashing is  approved for minimal usage according to the Association of periOperative  Registered Nurses (AORN), and it should be done only when there is not  sufficient time to process by the preferred terminal sterilization.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steam flush pressure pulse (SFPP) is performed  in CPD and is the recommended way of sterilizing instruments. IUSS should not  be used as a substitute for sufficient instrument inventory according to the Guideline  for Sterilization in the AORN Guidelines for Perioperative Practices, 2015  Edition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late 2016, Zimmer noted  that the number of GYN TruClear cases in the Surgical Suite had been increasing  over the last two years and met with Witt to discuss the need to purchase more instrumentation.  Zimmer reviewed the GYN surgical volume with Witt and explained that it had  been increasing over the past two years. The volume rose from 20 cases in first  quarter 2015 to 31 cases in fourth quarter 2016, a 55% increase in two years. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">TL7, TruClear Case  Volume</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increase in the volume of GYN TruClear  cases led to an increase in the flashing of surgical instruments to ensure their  availability for the surgeon. There will always be flashing, although it should  never exceed two flashes per day. Zimmer explained to Witt that the increase in  volume had led to an increase in the number of flashes. Flashing is a safe and  quick sterilization process, but it is recommended that an instrument not be  flashed more than twice day.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Witt reviewed the data and determined that the  number of flashings increased from 19 in first quarter 2015 to 38 in fourth  quarter 2016, a 50% increase in two years. The number of days on which the  flashing recommendation was exceeded was also increasing. Zimmer expressed  concern to Witt about the increased incidents of flashing.</p>

<p align="center">TL7, Number of  Flashings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL7-2.pdf">(Evidence TL7-2,  GYN TruClear Case Volume and Number of Flashings) </a></p>
<p>To maintain the integrity and useful life of  instrumentation, it is recommended that instrument sets should be used and  sterilized for no more than two use cycles within a 24-hour period. The  TruClear instrumentation set is used for operative hysteroscopy, polypectomy  and myomectomy.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 20, 2017, Zimmer began to express the need  for more TruClear instrumentation sets, both verbally and through email  communications. Zimmer expressed concern that BGP &ldquo;was so close to cancelling  cases, in fact more than a dozen times.&rdquo; <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL7-3.pdf">(Evidence TL7-3, Email from Zimmer to Witt)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 31, 2017, Zimmer sent Witt an email  outlining the difficulties that might arise in April 2017. Zimmer noted that  there were 11 TruClear cases scheduled in April, which would potentially lead  to issues on April 11 and 12. She wrote to Witt, &ldquo;On April 11th and  12th, we will face an issue of cancellation or delay if the loaner  is returned, or our sets face repair. Any word on obtaining the difficult  capital to purchase just one small set to alleviate our continual, current  issue.&rdquo; <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL7-4.pdf">(Evidence TL7-4,  Emails from Zimmer to Witt) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Acquired Resources</strong><br>
  TruClear instrumentation is quite costly, at  nearly $21,000 per set. Zimmer repeatedly communicated the need for more  TruClear instrumentation sets, both verbally and in written form, and stated  her concern about using the IUSS process more often than is recommended. As  capital dollars are in great demand, Witt carefully evaluates and determines  the greatest need for resources.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After numerous communications from Zimmer, Witt  sought final approval for the purchase of an additional TruClear instrument  set. Final approval for capital purchases require a compelling rationale to  justify the purchase. The purchase would result in a decrease of IUSS rates and  provide great relief to the clinical nurses by ensuring the proper  instrumentation would be available for the patients.  <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the information provided by Zimmer,  Witt approached Rick Swaine, MBA, MSF, CPA, Hospital President, to obtain  immediate capital funding for the TruClear instrument set. Swaine approved funding  for the purchase, and Witt purchased two sets of instruments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On April 26, 2017, a purchase order was created  for one set of TruClear surgical instruments, which was received in May 2017. The  second purchase ordered was entered on May 30, 2017, and BGP Surgical Services  expects a June 2017 delivery.<br>
  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL7-5.pdf">(Evidence  TL7-5, Purchase Orders and Email Regarding Purchases)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Care Delivery System</strong><br>
  The nurse leader, with clinical nurse input,  used trended data to support the purchase of additional surgical instruments to  support the delivery of required patient care in the Surgical Suite. With the  extra equipment there is less need for flashing, which it is recommended be  done only twice per day. Ensuring that adequate equipment is available to meet  patient care needs in a safe environment supports the patient-centered care  delivery system of Beaumont Grosse Pointe. <strong></strong></p>
