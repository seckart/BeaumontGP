<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: Unplanned Change – Displacement of Administrative Manager in Surgical Services</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong> <br>
  The job  description of the Administrative Manager at Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP)  requires a BSN degree. To support all Administrative Managers to obtain a BSN  degree, BGP established the Enhanced Educational Assistance (EEA) initiative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Enhanced Educational Assistance was  provided to six nursing leaders who did not have a BSN degree. The EEA included  an additional tuition assistance of $6,000 per year in addition to the current  $2,000 tuition assistance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On July 15, 2015, the Administrative Manager of  the Operating Room (OR) signed an Enhanced Educational Assistance Benefit  Agreement stating that he would receive an additional $6,000 per year in educational  assistance to obtain a BSN degree by December 31, 2016</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 2, 2016, Randy Whitney, MSA, BSN, RN,  NE-BC, Director of Professional Practice, sent an email to the Administrative  Managers (AM) in the EEA program inquiring about their graduation dates. All  recipients responded with graduation dates no later than December 15, 2016. As  the Director of Professional Practice, Whitney was responsible for following up  with all the AMs in the EEA program to ensure they completed the educational  requirement by the specified deadline. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL5-1.pdf">(Evidence TL5-1, Email from Randy Whitney)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November 2016, Whitney contacted the two  remaining AMs who had not yet completed their BSN degree to inquire about  graduation. One AM responded that she would graduate on December 15, 2016, and the  second stated that he ran into some issues and would not be graduating until  April 2017. Whitney immediately notified Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC,  Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer of the issue.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stewart spoke with Linda Witt, MA, BSN, RN,  CON, Director of Surgical Services, about the information that Whitney had  obtained and asked Witt to verify the information with the AM of Surgical  Services. The information was correct, and Stewart suggested to Witt that she  call a meeting with key individuals to discuss this unplanned event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Unplanned Change </strong><br>
  In late November 2016, Witt convened a meeting  to discuss the options for addressing the unplanned change that occurred in  Surgical Services. The individuals involved were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Linda  Witt, MA, BSN, RN, CON, Director of Surgical Services</li>
  <li>Anne  Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer</li>
  <li>Randy  Whitney, MSA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Director of Professional Practice and Magnet  Program Director</li>
  <li>Rick  Swaine, MBA, MSF, CPA, Hospital President</li>
  <li>Pandora  Walker, PHR, SHRM-CP Administrator, Human Resource</li>
  </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They  discussed the need for an immediate change in the administrative management of  Surgical Services. Witt asked Associate Nurse Manager Kathleen Vandelinder,  BSN, RN, CNOR to assume the position of Administrative Manager and gave  Vandelinder a couple of days to make her decision.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After  careful consideration, on December 5, 2016, Vandelinder declined the offer to  Witt and Walker. Walker therefore asked the employment specialist to post the  Administrative Manager position. Witt, who was not at the hospital that day,  sent an email to Stacey Frazee, Administrative Assistant for Surgical Services,  requesting that a memo be sent to all staff in the Operating Room regarding the  Administrative Manager position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Guiding Nurses through Change</strong> <br>
  Witt knew  this was going to be a difficult change for the OR staff, as the Administrative  Manager, D.F., was a well-respected leader in the OR and in the hospital. D.F.  started his career as a circulating nurse and was promoted to the AM position based  on his ideas and working relationship with the clinical nurses and surgical technologist  in the department. Witt determined that honesty about the situation was the  only way the staff would accept this unplanned change.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On  December 6, 2016, Witt asked the AM to send an email to the staff informing  them of his decision to step down as Administrative Manager of the ORs. D.F.  was very forthcoming in his email about the need for him to step down because  he had not obtained his BSN.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Witt&rsquo;s  assistance, he explained to the staff that he was aware of the requirements,  stressing that &ldquo;there are no hard feelings on my behalf in any capacity and  that I have enjoyed nearly &lsquo;every&rsquo; moment of being manager of your OR.&rdquo; <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL5-2.pdf">(Evidence TL5-2, Email from Vandelinder to Witt, Email  from DF to Administration and Witt to Operating Staff)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategies</strong><br>
  With the  Administrative Manager stepping down, Witt needed to implement strategies to  support nurses and the department during this time of unplanned change in  leadership.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong><br>
  On  December 15, 2016, during a Surgical Services Leadership meeting, Witt  discussed her interim plan for the management of operations of the department. The  duties of the Administrative Manager would be distributed to other members of  the surgical leadership team. Witt informed the OR staff during daily huddles  that she would now be responsible for the day to day operations of the unit and  any performance issues for the staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Witt held ongoing meetings with the Surgical Services  staff regarding issues that occurred in the OR. For example, when concerns  about room turnover were raised, Witt sent an email to the nursing staff to  remind them of the importance of ensuring that the rooms are being turned over  in a timely manner. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL5-3.pdf">(Evidence TL5-3, December 15, 2016  Surgical Service Meeting Minutes, January 9, 2017 Memo Announcing DF Stepping Down  and Memos regarding Day to Day Operations)</a> (The memo was sent in January  because of the holiday.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Witt demonstrated her leadership during the  transition by providing guidance to nurses on operational issues including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Communication  regarding suicide prevention awareness for the clinical nurses in preparation  for an upcoming Joint Commission visit. Witt guided the nurses in the  expectations for the clinical nurses in the Surgery area and highlighted two  policies that the nurses should be aware of.</li>
  <li>Communication  regarding assisting the physician to ensure that all patients who leave the PACU  have a brief operative note. Witt explained the issues and asked the clinical  nurses to lead this effort to ensure the patients received the appropriate  care.</li>
  </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Responding to Clinical Nurses&rsquo; Feedback</strong><br>
  The  on-call in surgery provides one example of Witt guiding the clinical nurses. As  a Level 3 Trauma Center, BGP is required to be able to open a surgical suite  within 30 minutes after a Level 1 trauma presents at the Emergency Center. A  number of clinical nurses expressed concern about the 30-minute requirement. To  address their concerns regarding this requirement, Witt reviewed alternative  plans with Rick Swaine, MBA, MSF, CPA,  Hospital President, and will keep the clinical nurses informed of the plans to  address this issue.  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL5-4.pdf">(Evidence TL5-4, Email from Witt to Surgery Nurses dated 6/27/17, 6/6/17 and  5/30/17) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During  this unplanned change, Witt was very visible to the nurses in Surgical Services  and was therefore able to assist nurses with issues that arose. Examples  included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assisting  Kristen Levi, RN, CNOR, clinical nurse, with the knowledge of a guest who would  be observing a physician during a surgery</li>
  <li>Assisting  Levi with the equipment needs of a physician related to an upcoming surgical  procedure</li>
  <li>Assisting  Laura Gleason, BSN, RN, Clinical Infection Preventionist, with appropriate  classification of a specimen<br>
<a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL5-5.pdf">(Evidence TL5-5, Email from Witt to Nurses  dated 4/24/17, 6/22/17 and 4/4/17)</a>  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through  the strategies of visible leadership, communication and addressing the needs of  clinical nurses, Witt guided the Surgical Services nursing staff through the  unplanned change in leadership of the Operating Room. The Administrative  Manager position remains unfilled at this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Two: Planned  Change – Implementation of Web Scheduler</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In September 2015, a variety of scheduling  practices were used in the Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP) Nursing Department. All  inpatient units used a paper and pencil schedule; some were self-scheduling, others  had a master schedule model and some had scheduling teams as a subgroup of the Unit  Practice Council. No matter which model was used, however, there was  dissatisfaction among the clinical nurses and nursing care assistants about  scheduling practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Internal Resource Team (IRT), the  contingent staff, used a software scheduling program called &ldquo;Web Scheduler,&rdquo;  which is part of the ANSOS One Staff staffing and scheduling program. The use  of Web Scheduler was initiated with the IRT in 2013 to accommodate this  flexible workforce. With this program, staff can view the open shifts on the  schedule and fill in where there is a need. A rollout of Web Scheduler to  inpatient units was discussed numerous times over the years, but there was no  momentum to take on this project. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nurse Leader</strong><br>
  In September 2015, Randy Whitney, MSA, BSN, RN,  NE-BC, Director Professional Practice and Magnet Program Director, transferred  to BGP from Beaumont Royal Oak.   Whitney&rsquo;s scope of responsibilities at BGP included:<strong></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Nursing  Education</li>
  <li>Nursing  Business Office</li>
  <li>Internal  Resource Team</li>
  <li>Magnet  Program</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
  Whitney was very aware of his responsibilities, as these were the same departments  he was responsible for at Beaumont Royal Oak. While he was orientating to his  new role at BGP, the issue of scheduling surfaced on various units of the  hospital. The issues that were identified were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The  delay in posted schedules</li>
  <li>The  delay in getting switches approved</li>
  <li>General  errors in the schedules</li>
  </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinical  nurses were bringing these issues to Whitney because he was responsible for the  Nursing Business Office, which completed the scheduling process for the  hospital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of Whitney&rsquo;s goals that was identified on  his 2015 Leadership Appraisal was to review and make recommendations to enhance  the Nursing Business Office by April 1, 2016. One way of enhancing the Nursing  Business Office was to implement Web Scheduler, as this program would  streamline its work. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL5-6.pdf">(Evidence  TL5-6 Whitney&rsquo;s 2015 Leadership Appraisal)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  December 2015, Whitney met with Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RN, NE-BC, Vice  President and Chief Nursing Officer, to discuss the possibility of all nursing  staff using Web Scheduler. Whitney shared with Stewart some of the comments he  had been hearing from the nursing staff regarding the scheduling process.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whitney  told her that, at Beaumont Royal Oak, he had been instrumental in implementing  the Web Scheduler program. Stewart supported the concept and suggested that the  idea be presented to the Nursing Leadership Team to gain support. Whitney  presented the idea informally to the leaders after a daily huddle, and all were  supportive. There was some hesitation because they were not familiar with the  program, its benefits and its use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategies used for Planned Change  </strong><br>
  <em>Leadership Support/Approval and Development of  an Implementation Plan</em><br>
  Whitney&rsquo;s  first strategy was to ensure that the Administrative Manager and Assistant  Nurse Managers were aware of the program capabilities and how it would benefit  them and the nursing staff. On February 8, 2016, Whitney arranged a four-hour  meeting with representatives from the ANSOS group to give an in-service on the  Web Scheduler program. The in-service was held at the Lakeland building from 1  to 5 p.m. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Whitney also reached out to Patricia Avery,  Clinical Information Support at Beaumont Royal Oak, to get a copy of the staff  version user manual that was distributed to the staff at Beaumont Royal Oak. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL5-7.pdf">(Evidence TL5-7, Email Regarding  In-Service, Handouts and Web Scheduler Manual)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After seeing the benefits of Web Scheduler, the  Nursing Leadership Team agreed that this change in the scheduling process  should be approved and moved forward for implementation at BGP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2016, after the in-service, Whitney  met with Stewart to share thoughts from the Nursing Leadership Team and to  develop a plan to move forward with the planned change. The objective of this  planned change was to change the scheduling process for clinical nurses and the  Nursing Leadership Team. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Engaging External  Experts</em><br>
  Whitney  knew this was a larger project than he could handle, so he approached Stewart  about engaging McKesson to provide the education to nurse leaders and clinical  nurses on the functions of Web Scheduler. On February 22, 2016, a call was held  with Jeffrey Hibbard, Account Executive from McKesson, to discuss entering into  an agreement with McKesson to provide the education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funding was approved, and on April 15, 2016,  BGP executed a contract with McKesson to provide education to convert to Web Scheduler.  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL5-8.pdf">(Evidence TL5-8, Email,  Contract, Invoice and Purchase Order for Education for Web Scheduler) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Providing Comprehensive Education to Key  Stakeholders</em><br>
  Whitney developed  and facilitated a comprehensive education program for nurse leaders and  clinical nurses prior to the rollout of Web Scheduler. The education was held  at BGP in the IT training room at various times of the day to ensure that all  staff members who were interested in the program could attend. Education was  provided on both the day shift and afternoon shifts. Whitney attended most of  the sessions to answer any questions nurse leaders or clinical staff had  regarding the new program and changes. The benefits of the planned change were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All  scheduled requests would be in the computer and the clinical nurse could track  the progress of the request.</li>
  <li>When  the clinical nurse wanted to change a work day, they could send the request to  multiple clinical nurses at the same time requesting someone to switch instead  of the current practice of verbally asking someone to switch.</li>
  <li>The  clinical nurse is notified automatically of the approval or denial of the  request.</li>
  <li>If  two clinical nurses switch days, and they are even switch without overtime, the  switch would automatically occur without manager approval.</li>
  <li>Web  Scheduler is a web-based program so clinical nurses are able to access it from  their computer at home.</li>
  </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on  the suggestion of clinical nurses during the training, Whitney reached out to  Marti Sejnost-Good, Supervisor Nursing Business Office, to develop training  material for the NBO staff to prepare them to use Web Scheduler. In addition to  the Staff Version User Manual previously mentioned, Sejnost-Good developed, at the request of Whitney, two  handouts with screen shots on how to view schedule and swap shifts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whitney  also arranged for the education for the nurse leaders to prepare them for their  responsibilities with Web Scheduler. The nurse leader education included the following  agenda items:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Employee  Role Function</li>
  <li>Administrator  Role Function</li>
  <li>Manager  Functions</li>
  </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Engaging Super-Users</em><br>
  Super-users  were employed to provide peer-to-peer education and support through the change.  The super-users would assist other staff members as needed. The super-user  could be a charge nurse, clinical nurse working on the professional ladder or nursing  care assistant. The training for super-users was held on June 9 and June 10,  2016. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whitney  was responsible to ensure there were adequate numbers of super-users on each  shift. The use of the super-user strategy was based on Whitney&rsquo;s experience as  a nurse leader.  To ensure its success, it  was imperative that there were staff members on each shift who were very  comfortable with the system to make the transition as smooth as possible. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL5-9.pdf">(Evidence TL5-9 Educational  Material for Clinical Nurses and Email regarding Nurse Leader Education; Email June  2, 2016 Requesting Super-Users) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Successful Planned Change</strong><br>
  On June  13, 2016 during the Model of Care Meeting, Whitney discussed the final rollout  plans for Web Scheduler. The Model of Care Meeting is a weekly meeting that the  entire nursing leadership attends to review issues that affect the hospital. It  was decided that September 4, 2016 would be the most logical date for the rollout.  This was the beginning of a new schedule and would work well with the current  scheduling. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL5-10.pdf">(Evidence TL5-10,  Agenda and Minutes of June 13, 2016 MOC and Attendance Roster)  </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The target  date of September 2016 was decided for full implementation of Web Scheduler. Clinical  nurses and leaders seemed pleased with the potential of the program, and many  began using the program before the official launch. The nursing department was  almost paperless with trade requests before the go-live date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinical  nurses seemed excited about this technology, the potential to look at their  schedule and make changes from a remote area without the need to fill out paper  forms, wait for the second person to sign and then obtain the leader&rsquo;s  signature, as this was time consuming and fraught with potential for human  error. With Web Scheduler, this is completed electronically and the approvals  are sent via email.  Additionally, this  is also a satisfier for the staff of the Nursing Business Office, as they no  longer need to decipher handwriting and enter the schedule changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the  guidance of Whitney, a planned change of implementing Web Scheduler on all  nursing units occurred at BGP. The clinical nurses and the Nursing Business  Office staff have found that the new scheduling process has saved time and improved  turnover time on schedule additions or schedule changes.  </p>
