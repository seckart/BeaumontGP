<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: CNO Involvement in Organization  Decision Making – Transitioning a Long-Term Care Facility Area into a  Medical/Surgical Unit  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Administrative  Team, which is the highest-level committee at Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP),  meets weekly with the following individuals attending:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rick Swaine, MBA, MSF,  CPA, Hospital President </li>
  <li>Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN,  RNC, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer</li>
  <li>Christine  Stesney-Ridenour, MBA, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer</li>
  <li>Kristen Cavender, BSIE,  MBA, CSSBB, Administrative Director</li>
  <li>Robert Kilpatrick,  BSRS, RTR, Administrative Director</li>
  <li>Maria Miller,  Controller BGP</li>
  <li>Donna Hoban, MD, Senior  Vice President and Physician in Chief</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s  focus is to make executive, strategic and operational decisions for BGP,  addressing issues including strategic planning, financial performance, human  resources, quality, regulatory and other executive issues. The CNO is an active  and equal partner in all organizational decisions at BGP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One issue  that the team discussed was transitioning a long-term care facility area into a  medical/surgical unit at BGP. The following describes the CNO&rsquo;s involvement in  the planning and development of the area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CNO Involvement – Planning</strong><br>
  During a  January 2015 Vice Presidents meeting, which is a subgroup of the Administrative  Team, the group discussed backfilling 3 North. This meeting is attend by Stewart,  Swain, Stesney-Ridenour and Hoban. An Evaluation Team was appointed at this  meeting, with Stewart assigned as the senior executive sponsor to assist in  leading it. The team consisted of:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Anne Stewart MBA, BSN,  RNC, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer</li>
  <li>Kristen Cavender, BSIE,  MBA, CSSBB, Administrative Director </li>
  <li>Christine Grumeretz,  Facilities Architect Planner, REDP Planning </li>
  <li>Stephanie Magina,  Senior Project  Manager, Project Development BGP – Facilities</li>
  <li>Maria Miller,  Controller BGP</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  Evaluation Team, which Stewart was a member of, was going to evaluate four  proposals regarding what would occupy the 3 North space. The proposed uses  were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inpatient rehabilitation  unit </li>
  <li>Medical/surgical telemetry  private room unit</li>
  <li>Geriatric-psych unit </li>
  <li>Continue the lease with  the long-term acute care hospital (LTACH)  </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL4-1.pdf">(Evidence TL4-1, Agenda VP Meeting,  January 7, 2015 and Email Communication)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Evaluation  Team was to evaluate each proposal and present their recommendation to the BGP Hospital  Administrative Team, which CNO Stewart is a member of, on February 10, 2015. Stewart,  representing hospital administration, led the Evaluation Team and was involved  in researching each proposal since nursing plays an integral role in three of  the four options.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Inpatient Rehab</em><br>
  Stewart met  with Grumeretz to discuss The Joint Commission and State of Michigan requirements  for an inpatient rehab unit, and she held conference calls with the  Rehabilitation nursing leaders from Beaumont Hospital Royal Oak and Beaumont  Hospital Troy. Following the calls and further investigation into the code  requirements, the team&rsquo;s recommendation was to not pursue an inpatient rehabilitation  unit because of space constraints. The space would allow for 8-10 rehab beds,  which the staffing requirements would make it fiscally difficult to  maintain.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Medical/Surgical Telemetry Unit</em><br>
  With many  patients waiting in the Intensive Care Unit and Emergency Center for telemetry  monitoring, another proposal was to open a medical/surgical telemetry private  room unit on which all beds would be telemetry capable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Telemetry  monitoring service (TMS) at BGP is done remotely from Beaumont Royal Oak. Stewart  contacted Monique Brand, BA, Cardiology Manager at Beaumont Royal Oak, to  discuss the feasibility of adding telemetry monitoring beds at BGP. Brand  informed Stewart that there was no additional capacity to expand the TMS at BGP  due to the space constraints, and she suggested that services could be added if  BGP moved TMS to another location.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Geriatric-Psych Unit</em><br>
  On  January 20, 2015, Stewart, Miller and Cavender held a conference call with  nursing colleagues at Beaumont Hospital Farmington Hills, which was the only  hospital in Beaumont Health that had an Inpatient geriatric-psych unit.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the  call from Beaumont Farmington Hills was Dahlia Klein, MSN, RN, CCRN, CCM, Director  of Nursing; Terry Slavin, Director of Reimbursement; and Regina Doxtader, Controller.  It became clear early in the call that a geriatric-psych service was  operationally and administratively labor intensive because of the many regulations  and personnel requirements, and that BGP did not have the breadth and depth of  expertise to pursue this option.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Long-Term Acute Care Hospital</em><br>
  Multiple  meetings were held with Select Specialty Hospital to discuss their plans for  the following year. Select Specialty wanted to renew the lease providing they  could obtain more administrative space and another five-year contract. As BGP  was unable to meet either condition, it was decided that continuing with an  LTACH was not feasible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On  February 7, 2015, Stewart, Cavender, Grumeretz, Magina and Miller met to  discuss strategies and recommendations for the February 10, 2015 meeting with  the Administrative Ream when they would present their recommendation on what  would backfill 3 North once the LTACH left. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Organizational Decision Making</strong><br>
  The  Administrative Team met on February 10, 2015 to review the proposals from the Evaluation  Team. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL4-2.pdf">(Evidence TL4-2,  Evaluation Team Proposal and Agenda from Administrative Team Meeting)</a> Based  on the information they gathered and an increasing volume, the Evaluation Team  recommended converting the Select Specialty space into a medical/surgical private  room unit. This would give patients privacy and help with patient flow from the  Emergency Center. With patient volumes increasing, it was difficult for the  unit clinical nurses to match patients by sex, isolation status or other types  of fit, which takes valuable time and resources to accommodate as patients are  transferred.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During  the next six months, discussions were held with various individuals regarding  the renovation and capital needs to re-establish 3 North as a medical/surgical  unit. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL4-3.pdf">(Evidence TL4-3,  Request for Capital Requirements)</a>  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the CNO/Administrator  for 3 North, Stewart was instrumental in advocating for capital dollars for its  renovation. Stewart was very aware of issues related to the placement of  admitted patients, and that the addition of 21 private beds would allow for a  smoother transition of patients from the Emergency Center to the inpatient units. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  decision regarding the backfill of 3 North had not been made at this point, so  Stewart began lobbying for the area to become an all private medical/surgical  area. In August 2015, Beaumont Health Corporate offices began questioning the  BGP Administrative Team about the recommendation to add beds at BGP when the  occupancy report often reported the average daily census at around 50%  occupied.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On paper,  it did not look like BGP needed additional patient care areas, so a special  meeting was set in </p>
<p>November 2015 with Beaumont Health Chief Financial Officer John  Keuten and the BGP Administrative Team, including Stewart, to discuss the Administrative  Team&rsquo;s desire to opt out of renewing the Select Specialty lease.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stewart,  Swain, Hoban and Stesney-Ridenour presented an Occupancy Summary to put into  perspective the hospital&rsquo;s true capacity and occupancy challenges. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL4-4.pdf">(Evidence TL4-4, Occupancy Summary,  November 25, 2015)</a></p>
<p>Following this meeting, Keuten supported the BGP  Administrative Team&rsquo;s recommendation of adding beds at BGP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  December 2015, following several discussions with Select Specialty, a final  decision was made for Select Specialty to vacate BGP in June 2016.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  February 2016, BGP hospital administration was approached with a proposal to  move another long-term care facility, Vibra, to the area vacated by Select  Specialty. Vibra has a Joint Venture with the legacy Oakwood Hospital System,  which became part of Beaumont Health in 2014. Because Vibra had a history with  the system, this became a dilemma. The idea of Vibra moving into the area was  met with resistance, especially from nursing, and Stewart was concerned about moving  another LTACH into the area based on input from nursing staff and leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During  summer 2016, many discussions were held between BGP, Beaumont Health and Vibra regarding  moving the LTACH into BGP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An  informal meeting between Steward and Swaine was held on September 1, 2016, and  a final decision was made that the unit would become a 21-private bed medical/surgical  unit caring for patients with medical/surgical and neurological diagnoses. Renovations  and updating began in October 2016, with a projected occupancy in first quarter  2017. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Two: CNO Involvement in Organizational Technology  Decision Making – Computer Replacement for Beaumont Grosse Pointe</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background </strong><br>
  Anne  Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer at  Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP), is a member of the BGP Administrative Team, which  includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rick Swaine, MBA, MSF, CPA,  Hospital President </li>
  <li>Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN,  RNC, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer</li>
  <li>Kristen Cavender, BSIE,  MBA, CSSBB, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer</li>
  <li>Robert Kilpatrick,  BSRS, RTR, Administrative Director</li>
  <li>Maria Miller, Controller  BGP</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During  many of the Nurse Leader Forums in early 2016, Stewart heard about the  condition of the computers on the nursing units through the hospital, referred  to as &ldquo;WOWs,&rdquo; or portable workstations on wheels.  The WOWs are located throughout the hospital and are used by many different departments  and individuals, including nurses, physicians, respiratory therapists, and care  management, and pharmacy personnel, to document in the electronic medical  record.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the  equipment was still functional, the clinical nurses reported that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The computers were  always broken and took too long to get fixed.</li>
  <li>The computers were slow  and would lock up.</li>
  <li>The screens were dimly  lit and too small to read easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on  the feedback from the clinical nurses, Stewart spoke with Information Technology  (IT)about the process for obtaining new computers for the organization. IT  responded that the computers are now a capital item and that capital dollars  are required to purchase new ones.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Organizational Decision Making</strong><br>
  In preparation  for the opening of a new Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU), Stewart asked the  clinical nurses in the Critical Care Unit (CCU) to trial a new computer and  workstation. The new computer addressed all the issues that were identified by  the clinical nurses, and they recommended purchasing them for use organization-wide. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  computers were purchased in March 2016 for a trial of the hardware, with the  understanding that if the CCU clinical nurses thought they were acceptable they  would be purchased for the new SICU and then hospital-wide once the capital  dollars were approved. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL4-5.pdf">(Evidence  TL4-5, Quotes for Computer, Workstations and PO) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During  the Administrative Team&rsquo;s weekly meeting on September 27, 2016, Stewart requested  that dollars be allocated in the capital budget to purchase new computers and  workstations for the organization. The capital budget allocation is decided by all  the members of the Administrative Team, who decide how the capital dollars that  are allocated to BGP from the Corporate Office are distributed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this  meeting, Stewart shared the clinical staff&rsquo;s feedback about the condition of  the WOWs and the perceived lack of available computers. She also shared the CCU  clinical nurses&rsquo; feedback about the computers that were trialed in the unit and  would be purchased for the new SICU. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL4-6.pdf">(Evidence TL4-6, Administrator&rsquo;s Weekly Meeting Minutes, September 27,  2016)</a></p>
<a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL4-6.pdf"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stewart  was successful in advocating for the new computers. This new, state of the art  technology will meet the needs of all clinical staff members who use the  computers for research and documentation in the electronic medical record. The  2017 capital budget was completed, and $330,000 was allocated to purchase new  WOWs in third quarter 2017. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL4-7.pdf">(Evidence  TL4-7, 2017 Capital Budget Allocation)</a></p>
<a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL4-7.pdf"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  January 2017, BGP opened a 21-bed medical/surgical unit, 3 North East. The  input from the CCU clinical nurses was used to support Stewart&rsquo;s decision to  purchase the new WOWs and computers for this new unit as well, and the staff  loves them. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL4-8.pdf">(Evidence TL4-8,  PO and Email March 2, 2017 regarding Staff&rsquo;s Opinion of Computer)</a></p>
<a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL4-8.pdf"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CNO Involvement in Planning</strong><br>
  The issue  of the computers was brought up during a Culture of Safety Town Hall on the  Critical Care Stepdown Unit (CCSU) on January 16, 2017. The clinical staff said  they continued to struggle with the computers, as they were always broken and  the same computer would sometimes have to be sent down as many as six times for  repair. After hearing these comments from the staff and how the issues  continued to affect patient care, Stewart contacted Kori Ogden, Equipment Manager  for Beaumont Health, to discuss the issue.<strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stewart  negotiated a plan to address the issue of broken computer technology:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ogden would come to BGP  to talk with the staff.</li>
  <li>CCSU would be  prioritized for computer refresh.</li>
  <li>IT would ensure that  all computers are working before returning.</li>
  <li>Stewart arranged for Subra  Sripada, Executive Vice President, Chief Transformation Officer and Chief  Information Officer, to meet with the CCSU staff regarding the computer issues. </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL4-9.pdf">(Evidence TL4-9, Culture of Safety Town  Hall Minutes)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the  Culture of Safety Town Hall, it was apparent that immediate action was required  to correct this problem. Stewart requested from the IT department a status of  all the computers and WOWs at BGP, and in a meeting with the CCSU Sripada said  BGP would be the priority for computer replacement.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The WOW  and PC Refresh plan was put into place on February 27, 2017, and IT was going  to do a complete inventory of all the computers and WOWs at BGP. Stewart shared  her concern with Susan Grant, DNP, RN, FAAN, NEA-BC, Executive Vice President  and Chief Nursing Officer, Beaumont Health, who told Stewart that a WOW Refresh  Analysis was completed for all of Beaumont Health and would be shared at a  future Nurse Executive Council meeting.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Beaumont  Health CNOs and Nursing Vice Presidents sit on the system-wide Nurse Executive  Council, which meets to discuss nursing issues. The Computer WOW Inventory and  Analysis was presented at its March 30, 2017 meeting. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/TL4-10.pdf">(Evidence TL4-10, WOW and PC Refresh Grosse Pointe,  2017 WOW Refresh Analysis, and Nurse Executive Council Minutes March 30, 2017) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the  process of replacing all the computers and WOWs at BGP continues, Stewart has  oversight and receives monthly updates on the progress of the computer  purchases at BGP. </p>
