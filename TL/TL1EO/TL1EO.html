 <p><em>Provide one example,  with supporting evidence, of an initiative identified in the nursing strategic  plan that resulted in an improvement due to a change in clinical practice.  Supporting evidence must be submitted in the form of a graph with a data table  that clearly displays the data.</em></p>
<br>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example One: Improving Nurses&rsquo; Perception of Patient Safety  in the Nurse Practice Environment by Using the Internal Resource Team</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  One of the goals in the 2014 Nursing Strategic Plan was  to increase patient safety on the nursing units at Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP)  through improvements in the nurse practice environment.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinical nurses identified in a survey that the  units were safe, but that production pressure would sometimes increase when  there was a change in the practice environment due to staffing issues. Production  pressure is defined as the feeling of being overworked, such as having multiple  patient requests, multiple admissions and overall a very busy day. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BGP has used the Agency for Healthcare Research and  Quality (AHRQ) to measure the culture of safety on the patient care units. The  AHRQ created patient safety culture assessment surveys for hospitals and  physician offices/ambulatory settings as part of the goal to improve patient  safety in the nation&rsquo;s healthcare system.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Safety culture surveys are useful for measuring  organizational conditions that can lead to adverse events and patient harm in  healthcare organizations. BGP conducts the AHRQ survey every six months in the  areas of the hospital that provide direct patient care. The entire survey is  given in June of each year, and a mini-survey is administered in December. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the survey can be closed, at least 60%  of the nursing staff, including clinical nurses and nursing care assistants, must  have taken it. The mini-survey consists of item number five, Overall Perception  of Patient Safety, which also appears in the full survey. The questions that  make up the Overall Perception are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is just by chance  that more serious mistakes don&rsquo;t happen around here</li>
  <li>Patient safety is never  sacrificed to get  more work done</li>
  <li>We have patient safety  problems in this unit</li>
  <li>Our procedures and  systems are good at preventing errors from happening </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the Internal Resource Team (IRT), BGP&rsquo;s  float team, does not have a specific practice area, its clinical nurses are  still surveyed every six months. It was determined that because the IRT  clinical nurses float to all areas of the hospital, their culture of safety score would provide an overall estimate  of how well the nursing units are doing to provide a safe practice  environment.  </p>
<p>The survey is used to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Raise clinical nurses&rsquo;  awareness about patient safety</li>
  <li>Diagnose and assess the  current status of the practice environment</li>
  <li>Identify strengths and  areas for improvement</li>
  <li>Examine trends</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nursing  staff members are also able to write comments about the practice environment at  the hospital and how it affects safety. Clinical nurses&rsquo; comments about their  perception of how safety is affected at BGP included the following areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Staffing</li>
  <li>Production pressure </li>
  <li>Emergency Center  transfers</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous comments  related to safety</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The full survey measures staff perceptions of the safety  culture in the work area, as well as perceptions of the culture of the  hospital.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  following areas are covered in the survey:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Communication openness</li>
  <li>Feedback and  communication about error</li>
  <li>Frequency of event  reporting</li>
  <li>Hospital handoffs and  transitions</li>
  <li>Hospital management  support for patient safety</li>
  <li>Non-punitive response  to error</li>
  <li>Organizational  learning-continuous improvement</li>
  <li>Overall perception of patient safety</li>
  <li>Staffing</li>
  <li>Supervisor/manager  expectations and actions promoting patient safety</li>
  <li>Teamwork across  hospital units</li>
  <li>Teamwork within unit</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June  2014, the IRT&rsquo;s survey results showed a decrease in the Overall Perception of  Patient Safety: 61% of IRT clinical nurses indicated that safety was good, down  from 64% in December 2013 and below the AHRQ average of 66%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wendy Jolley,  BSN, RN, Administrative Manager of the IRT, believed these scores  needed to be addressed, so she began discussions with the Assistant Nurse  Managers of all units to make improvements in the nurse practice environment  related to resources. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal  Statement</strong><br>
  To improve the IRT clinical nurse AHRQ survey score  for Overall Perception of Patient Safety. 
  <br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the In tervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  During a Model of Care meeting in July 2014, Jolley  shared the Culture of Safety scores with the Assistant Nurse Managers of all  inpatient care units. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss ways to inform  the IRT clinical nurses of what the units are doing to improve the nurse  practice environment, thereby increasing safety on the patient care units. After  much discussion, it was decided that the Assistant Nurse Managers would send  the unit staff meeting minutes to Jolley, who would then summarize for the IRT  nurses what the units were doing to improve the practice  environment. Since the IRT staff members float to all units in the hospital,  they were not always aware what was going on each unit. If, for example, a unit  that was having an issue with falls changed its practice to have nurses  increase their rounding to every 30 minutes, this would be shared with the IRT  clinical nurses.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was very important for the IRT to be kept current  on all issues that affect patient care, and it was stressed that the IRT scores  would not increase unless the environment on all the units improved. Because  the IRT clinical nurses float to all areas, all areas must improve to have an  impact on the IRT clinical nurses&rsquo; Culture of Safety survey scores.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A meal break pilot program began in July 2014, with  the theme of &ldquo;Caregivers must care for themselves.&rdquo; Meal breaks consisted of  two one-hour periods, during which the clinical nurse and their break buddy  decide which break they want to take. They can go any time within the hour as  long as they are back at the top of the hour. The purpose was to improve the practice  environment by always having enough staff members on the unit while also  ensuring that all clinical nurses receive a break. Breaks are important since  they help clinical nurses remain focused while on the unit by giving them  enough time to step away from patient care and give their mind and body a rest,  a key element in providing a safe environment.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In August 2014, a Culture of Safety Action Plan was  developed by Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief  Nursing Officer, supported by Jolley and the Assistant Nurse Managers. They  made the following recommendations, which were supported by BGP:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Charge nurses assigned on the day shift on the  larger units </li>
  <ul>
    <li>This would give the nurses an extra pair of hands when the production  pressure was increasing on the unit.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Equal out staffing on both the day and midnight  shift</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This would allow the nurses on both shifts to have an equal number of  patients due to the workload on each shift. This would be a major change in the  nurse practice environment, as historically the nursing units always had one  less clinical nurse on midnights.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Hire additional IRT clinical nurses</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This would allow more clinical nurse support when the patient census  increases.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Hire an Emergency Center (EC) pharmacist to support  medication reconciliation in the EC</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This intervention would allow the nurses to focus on patient care. With a  pharmacist in the EC to complete medication reconciliation, the clinical nurses  on the inpatient units would know that the correct medications were ordered for  the patients. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late summer 2014, the IRT moved to its current  area, which is centrally located in the hospital so the IRT nurses now feel more  a part of the hospital. All IRT clinical nurses were also given individual  mailboxes to facilitate communication between them and Jolley. The increased  communication and sense of participation increased the IRT nurses&rsquo; awareness of  efforts across the organization to improve the safety of patients and staff.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From September 2014 through November 2014, Jolley  held staff meetings and individual meetings with all IRT clinical nurses  focusing on what was being done at BGP to improve the nursing practice  environment and thereby improve patient safety. The following changes to the  nursing practice environment were reviewed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding a charge nurse</li>
  <li>Adding midnight staffing</li>
  <li>Increasing the size of the IRT</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The discussions also focused on safety measures that  were put in place to ensure that clinical nurses are practicing in a safe  nursing environment. During the staff meeting, Jolley reviewed what BGP had  already accomplished to ensure a safe environment for patients and clinical  nurses. The following topics were reviewed at the staff meeting to demonstrate  ways that BGP provides a safe environment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bar code medication administration – Assists with  preventing medication errors</li>
  <li>Bed alarms – Assist with preventing patient falls</li>
  <li>Video monitoring rooms – Assist with preventing  patient falls</li>
  <li>Smart IV pumps – Ensure patients receive the correct  does of medication</li>
  <li>Pyxis medication dispenser – Assists with preventing  medication errors</li>
  <li>Fall alert – Assists with preventing falls</li>
  <li>RL safety reporting – A confidential way to report  safety concerns</li>
  <li>Electronic medical records – Provide access to the  patient clinical record</li>
  <li>Hand hygiene dispensers – Provide a clean  environment for the patients and clinical nurses</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example Two: Improvement in Clinical Practice –  &ldquo;It Takes Two&rdquo; Nurse/Physician Rounding </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  In November 2015, Kimberly Little, BSN,  RN, Assistant Nurse Manager of 2 South, went to the  2015 Press Ganey National Client Conference, where she attended a session on  improving nurse/physician communication. The seminar, based on nurse/physician  rounding, demonstrated that the patient and nurse both hearing what the  physician says decreases miscommunication and misunderstanding, increases  efficiency and patient satisfaction with communication scores for nurses and  physicians, and makes patients feel like everyone is on the same page. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each year at Beaumont Grosse Pointe (BGP), nurse  leaders gather at a retreat to set goals and develop strategic plans for the  next year. Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN, RNC, NE-BC, Vice President and Chief Nursing  Officer, sends an email to randomly selected clinical nurses to obtain feedback on the following question: </p>
<ul>
  <li>From your perspective,  can you tell me what you, as a nurse, want for your patients and your work  environment at Beaumont Grosse Pointe?</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2016 Nurse Leader Retreat was held on  November 30, 2015, and comments from clinical nurses surveyed were reviewed. The  following theme emerged from clinical nurses&rsquo; written comments to the nurse  leaders:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clinical nurses wanted  to improve nurse/physician communication to facilitate communication with the  patients. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  clinical nurses wanted improved communication with the physicians so they could  improve the care they were providing to the patients by reinforcing the same information  the physicians were giving to the patients. This was consistent with the  Nursing Strategic Plan goal to improve patient safety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every Tuesday, BGP holds a customer service  meeting to review the HCAHPS scores for the previous week received from Press  Ganey and other issues related to customer service. The meeting is for leaders  and clinical staff members from all areas of the hospital who can attend. The  January 12, 2016 customer service meeting included a discussion about the low  scores for the HCAHPS Nurse Communication and Physician Communication domains,  with the participants seeing the data indicating a problem with communication  from nurses and physicians. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, in fourth quarter 2015, 2 South  ranked in the 26th percentile for the HCAHPS Press Ganey &ldquo;Communication  with Nurses&rdquo; domain. The percentile ranking in the Press Ganey database is a  comparison of the unit&rsquo;s score within the benchmarking group; ranking in the 26th  percentile means that 74% of hospitals in the database are performing at a higher  level than 2 South. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Little was lobbying for 2 South to be chosen for  this improvement project, as she was impressed by the Press Ganey conference  presentation that showed an improvement in communication scores resulting from  nurse/physician communication. 2 South is a large medical unit that has a high response rate for the Press Ganey Surveys, and  Little knew that the unit had one of BGP&rsquo;s lowest scores in the communication  domain. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HCAHPS data also included patient  comments that were shared weekly with leaders to review and follow up with the  patients for service recovery. It was reported that the patients&rsquo; perception  was that the physicians did not take the time to explain things in terms they  understood. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another concern was the number of phone  calls made by patients to the charge nurses and/or Assistant Nurse Managers  about their plan of care following discharge. Many patients said they did not  understand the physician or that nurses were having a difficult time contacting  the physicians regarding their plan of care for the day. When informed of this,  clinical nurses said that if they understood the plan of care from the  physicians this would help them improve nursing practice in giving patients  accurate information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the above information, Little decided  that she would implement what she learned at the Press Ganey conference to  improve the scores for the Communication with Nurses domain.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Communication with Nurses domain consists  of three questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>During this hospital  stay, how often did nurses treat you with courtesy and respect?</li>
  <li>During this hospital  stay, how often did nurses listen carefully to you?</li>
  <li>During this hospital  stay, how often did nurses explain things in a way you could understand?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was clear that a plan was needed to improve  the patients&rsquo; perception of physicians and nurses communicating efficiently and  effectively in terms that the patient understands. The intervention would be  called &ldquo;It Takes Two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal Statement</strong><br>
  To improve 2 South&rsquo;s percentile ranking for HCAHPS  Press Ganey Nurse Communication domain, measured quarterly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description  of the Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  On January 21, 2016, Little proposed  developing nurse/physician rounding on 2 South to improve the Nurse and  Physician Communication HCAHPS domains. Little met with Anne Stewart, MBA, BSN,  RNC, NE-BC, Vice President, and Chief Nursing Officer, to organize a plan for  implementing nurse/physician rounding. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposal was to have five physicians  who would participate in the nurse/physician rounding. The physician would arrive  on the unit and inform the clinical assistant at the desk which patients they  were there to see, in the order that they would be seeing them. The clinical assistant  would then call the clinical nurse of those patients to inform them that the  physician had arrived and the order in which the patients would be seen. If the  clinical nurse was unable to meet the physician, the clinical assistant would  notify the charge nurse to go to the patient room with the physician. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key stakeholders for the nurse/physician  rounding process needed to be identified, so Little brought the proposal to Pam  Lively, BSN, RN, Assistant Nurse Manager of 2 South, who agreed to bring the proposal  to the 2 South Unit Practice Council (UPC). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On February 10, 2015, Lively and Little  took the idea to the UPC, whose membership included 2 South clinical nurses  Timothy Pierce, BSN, RN; Annette Gipperich, RN; Michael Hoekstra, BSN, RN;  Emily Gross, BSN, RN; and Beth Thomas, RN. The UPC agreed to have the  physician/nurse rounding trialed on 2 South. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On February 16, 2016, Little reviewed the  proposal for the nurse/physician rounding with the Medical Chiefs and Medical Executive  meeting for approval. Once approval was obtained, Little and Lively met with  Donna Hoban, MD to identify five physicians who she wanted to be part of the nurse/physician  rounding program. These were Mark Alrais, MD; Basem Almasri, MD; Manaf Madoun, MD;  Alaa Mansour, MD; and Bassam Matti, MD. Beginning February 17, 2016, Little and  Lively educated all 2 South clinical nurses on the process and expectations of  nurse/physician rounding. Nurse/physician rounding was a major change in  clinical practice for the clinical nurses. Prior to implementation of this  rounding, the physician would make rounds, talk with the patient and leave.  With this change in practice, the clinical nurses would now be active members  of the rounding team, allowing them to ask questions, ensure patients&rsquo;  questions are answered and improve the care provided to the patients. Clinical  nurses&rsquo; responsibilities include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Going to the bedside  with the physician to ensure that the clinical nurse heard what was being said  to the patient. </li>
  <li>Acting as the patient advocate  to ensure the patient had their questions addressed. </li>
  <li>Assisting the patient  with clarifying their concerns with the physician.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After  rounding, the nurse reviews the plan of care with the patient and family to  ensure they are aware of what the plan involves. Prior to the rounding, the  nurses may or may not have been aware of the plan of care. Now that they are  rounding with the physician, the clinical nurses are more knowledgeable about  the plan. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the clinical nurse was not able to meet the  physician, they were to make sure they informed the clinical assistant. The clinical  assistant would then call the charge nurse to ensure that a clinical nurse  would be present with the patient and physician. Little and Lively spoke of the  nurse/physician rounding process to the nurses and the five physicians involved  daily to prepare for the start date of March 1, 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On February 18, 2016, Little and Lively  spoke with Martha Sejnost-Good, Manager of the Clinical Assistants, to ensure that  2 South would consistently have a clinical assistant at the desk. Little and  Lively requested dedicated clinical assistants to champion and assist with the  rollout of physician/nurse rounding. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clinical assistant&rsquo;s role involved  multiple steps. Once the physician notified the clinical assistant of who they  were there to see, the clinical assistant would notify each clinical nurse in  the order the physician was seeing the patients. The clinical assistant would  also verify that the clinical nurse would be able to meet the physician in the  room. If the clinical nurse was not able to meet the physician, the assistant  would call the charge nurse, who would be responsible to round with the  physician on that patient. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A book was developed to document &ldquo;missed  rounds,&rdquo; instances of a physician or nurse not being able to make rounds, to  identify any barriers that should be addressed. If a pattern of missed rounds  was identified, Little and Lively would follow up with individual staff  members. Hoban would also be informed if a physician had a pattern of missed  rounds for follow-up. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March 2016, all interventions were  fully implemented. The change in clinical practice was complete, and nurse/physician  rounding began.</p>
